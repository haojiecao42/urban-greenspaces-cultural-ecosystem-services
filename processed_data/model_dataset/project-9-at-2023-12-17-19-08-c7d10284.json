pitted as the high cirrus clouds overhead. I came here because I wanted to explore something new, because I was unwilling and too cheap to pay the $1.50 for the major facility nearby for the base privilege of being sad and reading a book outdoors (such things, I am convinced and principled, should always be and remain free), because being down and not at least trying to wash away the cloak is sadder than the feeling itself.\n& so, I came here.\n\n…And I am eternally glad I did. Listening to Hank Williams Jr.’s rendition of “Cowpoke,” reading a book about the Indians of the plains held out at arm’s length, I saw clear waters that matched the clarity I felt when I finally left the park a couple hours later. Perch, sac a lait, various native reptiles, a few ducks, and a monster of a soft shell turtle made for good company as I paced the well paved-over walking trail around the ponds, and the sunset was a painting as magnificent a sight as anything Creation ever did.\n\nTruth be told, nothing had changed in my life during those one-hundred and twenty minutes: I was still alone, still lacking in companionship and love, want of money, but as the food in my stomach digested, and my mind likewise processed my environment, even though everything in my life was just as it was before I randomly found this oasis, everything had also simultaneously, profoundly, changed. Things were good. Life was joyous, and although dressed in a mellow mood, my spirits flew in the breeze, swaying just as the palmetto fans did. Yes, this park can be good and fortifying for the heart, and sometimes all one needs to change a sinking soul is a little patch of green space to remind you that yes, everything is gonna be alright.
