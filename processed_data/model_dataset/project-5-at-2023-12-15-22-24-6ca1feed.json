It has a very nice small education center, with a couple of walkouts to the water and a tower you can walk up or take an elevator up to the top. We also took the the 2 mile trail under the highway near the drawbridge, very poorly marked as far to which trail to take to stay on the looped trail.  The trail is very rocky and paved partially with cement, most likely to prevent erosion as the mangroves and water come right up to the trail during high tide. It was a nice January nature walk, not too much to see. We did however see a Yellow Crested Heron perched in the mangroves.

Saw many live birds and critters.  All the trails are worth the walk.  I would advise folks that the map you get from the vistor center is not to scale, look at the one on the trail instead.  BUG SPRAY IS A MUST.  The biting gnats are ferocious.  Bring something with Deet in it, 40% is good.  They mostly come out at low tide or later in the day I think, but don't quote me.  They stick to the dense mangrove areas but not to bad once you get out to the look outs or on the boat tour.  They don't leave a mark or itch, just painful as anything I have ever encountered in nature.This place is so well maintained.  I have seen many State parks so run down from having small budgets, but this place is a county park and must have some secret funding.

The trails close to the visitor center are all on raised wooden boardwalks to keep you above the mangroves. We saw lots of tree crabs and I never knew crabs could climb trees before this. The tree crabs are tiny and are also in the mud among the mangroves. Didn't see any birds though so that was disappointing. Winter would probably be better for birds. We didn't try any of the longer trails away from the visitor center because it's way too hot for that in the summer, even in the morning. Would definitely go back in the winter and spend more time. This attraction was very clean, including the restrooms inside the exhibit center. I only gave 4 stars because the woman working the visitor center knew nothing about the trails and couldn't really answer any questions -- or she didn't want to help. Another reviewer mentioned this too. There also weren't any decent maps of the trails at the visitor center. There is a small fee for the exhibit hall and it's worth it to help this very worthwhile nature center.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jun 2013 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Anne Kolb Nature Center"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.322479Z","updated_at":"2023-10-31T19:45:44.026696Z","inner_id":84,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1802,"annotations":[{"id":85,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":208,"end":238,"text":"it is truly a natural treasure","labels":["existence"]},"id":"I2AXeuhbGU","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":340,"end":396,"text":"if you've any interest in the natural habitat of Florida","labels":["existence"]},"id":"aSLufjq4CB","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-10-31T19:48:22.238454Z","updated_at":"2023-10-31T19:48:22.238454Z","draft_created_at":"2023-10-31T19:47:43.123455Z","lead_time":132.997,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"0c19e7cb-bbf1-488c-a44d-54bf31a15667","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1802,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Mr & Me","user_hometown":"Ukiah, CA","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Worth the time","content":"We had a very short window of opportunity to visit this center - unfortunately it was at dusk and we didn't have any bug spray - do not make this mistake if you go to visit.

The park is very active, especially on weekends with activities like a water park, golf driving range, water skiing and numerous pavilions for cookouts.  The park even has a concert area with shows during the year. The campground is an oasis in the park, set aside and surrounded by lakes.  Sites are large, not like a commercial,campground. Each site has water, electric & sewer as well as well placed bath houses. Recycling and trash are collected at each bath house.  Important to us is that it is dog friendly as long as you follow the normal common sense rules.  The campground is kid friendly with bike paths, a fishing pier and plenty of room to just be kids.  Being surrounded by water, most sites have a water view and a very relaxing feel. Being surrounded by the city, you can hear traffic at times, but nothing you wouldn't expect being this close in.

Entrance to the park is free during the week and $1.50 on weekends.  The park can sometimes be a little dirty, but the restrooms are always clean (well as clean as they can be).  We recently went to the water park, first visit since the renovation.  We went during the week and knew that local day camps would be enjoying a day there as well.  While the parking lot was packed, we were able to find plenty of seats and lounges.  The new slides were awesome - lines get a little long at times, but it was never terribly long.  The lazy river would get so packed, that it was almost comical to see the floats all bunched together.  We ended up spending almost all day there.  We had food from the snack bar (slow, but polite service), even though they allow coolers in the park.  Food was reasonably priced and not bad at all.  They had plenty of tables with umbrellas available for rent all day long.  We saw plenty of sheriffs in the park as well as there has been a really bad problem of cars getting broken into while you are off doing something (this is county-wide at all parks).  Admission is a few dollars lower after 3 and plenty of people come in after the day camps leave.  I saw that they don't offer refunds, but give you rain checks based on how long you have been at the water park.  The park itself could definitely use a little TLC - but I enjoy my visits there.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jul 2014 • Family","UGS":"Broward_CB Smith Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.322479Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T18:20:23.194864Z","inner_id":108,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1826,"annotations":[{"id":109,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":121,"end":138,"text":"The \"kiddie\" area","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"QEjifF46A0","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":41,"end":62,"text":"I spent the day there","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"BVKSoBUxZH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":107,"end":118,"text":"had a blast","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"-Qha3yuttC","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-01T18:22:20.629823Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T18:22:20.629823Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-01T18:21:46.581567Z","lead_time":110.901,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"694bbcdc-8ce3-45ff-bc40-ae522ddf7afc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1826,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Smiley39","user_hometown":"Stone Mountain, GA","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great family attraction","content":"What a great family park.

It isn't even fun to walk around because everywhere you walk looks just like where you started.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jul 2012 • Family","UGS":"Broward_CB Smith Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.322479Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T19:16:09.624716Z","inner_id":110,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1828,"annotations":[{"id":111,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":151,"end":163,"text":"fishing pier","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"ZeseDvCgrr","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":137,"end":149,"text":"a water park","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"_KHaCQTCNx","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":211,"end":232,"text":"Grounds are well kept","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"LqewkEW7EB","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-01T19:06:25.036165Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T19:06:25.036165Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-01T19:05:49.558049Z","lead_time":2592.566,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"ee9f5ba3-5a72-4a9d-924b-eed883510f8c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1828,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Peggy C","user_hometown":"Portland, OR","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Hidden gem for RV camping","content":"What a find!

The park is open every day in the summer, and only costs just under $10 a person (adults and children alike). There are two kiddie areas with spray guns, mini-slides, and dump buckets. Both areas have very shallow water (which varies from ankle-depth to mid-calf-depth). One area is themed around fruit and the other has an ocean theme. Very cute, but the buckets beep very loudly right before they dump to encourage the kids to come running, and the constant beeping is a little obnoxious. The kids, though, were super excited by the alert. You can ride double on some of the kiddie slides, which is great if you have very little ones with you. (We had three kids: 11, 10, and 2). The lifeguards let the 11 and 10 year old kids ride with the two year old AT FIRST, then we were told by their relief lifeguards that the toddler had to go with a grownup only. All five of the kiddie slides are nearly identical to one another; too big for little ones to go by themselves, but too small to be of much interest for the bigger kids for long.There is also a lovely lazy river with a lot of interactable objects around it. There are some bombs that kids will operate that force airbubbles up from the ground, squirters and sprayers in another section, and a bridge that may or may not suddenly begin pouring water onto unsuspecting floaters. You have to be in a tube (no free-floating). You can ride double in a tube with your little one.Finally, there are two large slides that entertained my older kids all day long. They are really great, smooth slides, and both are very different from one another. One is fast and rocks you around a lot. The other is slower but has a bigger drop. The wait for these was reasonable even at the busiest part of the day.There are tons of benches, chairs, and loungers scattered around the park. Some shaded, some in the sun, but plenty of room for everyone who was there with us. There are even some grassy areas if you prefer to set up your towel like you're at the beach. They even have covered picnic areas available for rent; these areas aren't very private, but instead are centrally located to all the attractions. There is a grill and some satellite food stations around. We chose not to eat at the park when we saw a big, homemade sign that read \"NO REFUNDS\" on one of the satellite stations. That scared us away. How many people are getting their food then wanting their money back to justify making a sign?! There are also lockers available for rent and huge restrooms with showers. The restrooms and grounds in general weren't the cleanest, but they certainly weren't gross. The water and wet areas were clean. We found the park to be a lot of fun, especially considering how inexpensive it was. Great way to spend a hot summer day in Florida.

Here’s the conversation:Employee: do you have a reservation.Me: yes ma’am.Employee: what’s your name and I need the tag number for your vehicle and camper.Me: okWalked out got the info and walked back in.Me: here’s the tag numbers ma’am.Employee: put this paper in your vehicle and this paper in your camper window.She hands me the passes and that’s it. No have a nice day, good bye, eat crap, nothing. Just some advice from someone who runs a business. Hire people who promote your business and are happy to be there, not some sour pusses that make the first impression bad.Have a blessed day.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Apr 2019 • Family","UGS":"Broward_CB Smith Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.338764Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T21:29:53.142687Z","inner_id":138,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1856,"annotations":[{"id":140,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":151,"end":200,"text":"Walking, running and jogging conditions are ideal","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"ATUXTE8bik","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":89,"end":149,"text":"sit by a lake under a shed and enjoy the salubrious outdoors","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"UIHPS3GbwS","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":17,"end":39,"text":"great locations to sit","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"FfUNOxPCR_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":44,"end":79,"text":"have lunch in a relaxing atmosphere","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"X7thX9pSZJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-01T21:31:48.790303Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T21:31:48.790303Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-01T21:31:05.985200Z","lead_time":115.441,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"33a23dec-f6a3-4d6b-aa60-2fc5f1490e5c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1856,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"DrJamezHill","user_hometown":"Pembroke Pines, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Lunch in the Park","content":"This park offers great locations to sit and have lunch in a relaxing atmosphere.

I was pleasantly surprised to see what it had to offer . You can spend as little as 45 minutes to 3-4 hours on the island. You can even have a BBQ however everything is bring it yourself as nothing is available on the island.There are very clean bathroom facilities so need to worry about that.The one negative I had is that there were a number of signs obviously giving some info about the wildlife or plant life that were so old they were faded out and as such you missed out on this info. This needs to be revived.Hints:- go in the morning when there is a little more action and the heat is so tough. - Be ready to deal see spiders. They are not dangerous but they are big. The  operators clear the paths in the morning but you need to be on the lookout if you decide to venture off the trails. I suggest picking up a dead palm branch to use in clearing any areas you want to go that have some webs in the way.- Don't make a lot of noise when walking the paths, and look far ahead before looking from side to side as you can see the wildlife. We saw a raccoon walking the path up ahead of us and a 3-4 ft iguana crossed our path. We also were able to catch up with 3 turtles.- Don't be shy to ask the operators working if they had seen any turtles. They often know where the nests are and might be able to help you catch a glimpse of them. -Typically the boat going to the island leaves on the hour, and it comes back at 10 minutes to the hour.-Take your time and enjoy the jungle of an island you are on in the middle of one of the more expensive areas in the US. It is nice to be able to jump on a 3 minute boat ride and sort of go back in time.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/bd\/78\/1b\/a-primary-resident-on.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/bd\/78\/1d\/on-watch-at-her-den.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/bd\/78\/1e\/no-fear.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Oct 2014 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Deerfield Island Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.338764Z","updated_at":"2023-12-16T03:16:42.035563Z","inner_id":157,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1875,"annotations":[{"id":159,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":26,"end":49,"text":"take a stroll in nature","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"lQg1V1PPak","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":66,"end":83,"text":"pontoon boat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"tWbblFTP7T","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":107,"end":126,"text":"a great walk around","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"0hGGuxTEU-","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-02T14:23:51.836461Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T19:16:21.995046Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-02T14:23:34.210619Z","lead_time":308.753,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"651e8dc9-502a-4656-b394-c13b0e75733c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1875,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Dante-Donna","user_hometown":"Yonkers, NY","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Awesome place to take a stroll and admire nature","content":"Wow what a great place to take a stroll in nature, a quick little pontoon boat ride to the island and then a great walk around..","img_urls":"","tour_time":"May 2019 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Deerfield Island Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.338764Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T19:16:22.035284Z","inner_id":158,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1876,"annotations":[{"id":160,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":232,"end":240,"text":"wildlife","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"P7Vj2gJeN2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":279,"end":323,"text":"covered areas that can be rented for parties","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"YD0Lulw_4T","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":219,"end":230,"text":"Nice trails","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"uVlFCRZjLq","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":88,"end":120,"text":"part of the history of Deerfield","labels":["heritage"]},"id":"kiMFLzXJ_X","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-02T14:26:18.946804Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T14:26:18.946804Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-02T14:25:50.426416Z","lead_time":145.646,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"23db69f7-ad4e-4e65-a75c-d26fbb22937a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1876,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Larry D","user_hometown":"Lighthouse Point, FL","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Deerfield Island Park nature reserve","content":"Most Deerfield Beach residents haven't been to Deerfield Island Park.

Needless to say it ruined the day and the rest of the week. Make sure you take everything with you on the boat. The employees were very helpful and understanding in our situation although nothing could be done to get our stuff back.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/04\/5a\/25\/eb\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Jun 2013 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.338764Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T01:21:33.561024Z","inner_id":197,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1915,"annotations":[{"id":199,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":116,"end":124,"text":"air boat","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"AOtMejac5H","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":132,"end":146,"text":"saw alligators","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"4sAdvcCpQR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":155,"end":173,"text":"The alligator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"gVz0MGeRDq","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":449,"end":465,"text":"Animal Encounter","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"_C7Rp2zj-U","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":479,"end":539,"text":"standing at a small booth holding a snake or small alligator","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"gl-7be7ew_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":544,"end":561,"text":"getting a picture","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"XIzys4p2dd","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-03T01:22:16.523661Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T18:17:35.371717Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-03T01:21:58.392507Z","lead_time":61.726,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"0e4bdd4e-51f2-47fe-a9fb-5380f843f22f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1915,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Susonka","user_hometown":"Philadelphia, PA","rating":"3.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Good Visit","content":"My family and I had a good time here.

Also, we were told that the filter was broken where the alligators were kept so it was really dirty looking.  I am sure it is fixed now.

Best bet is to get the $59 package that includes transportation.They have no rest rooms.  Must use gross port-o-potties.The airboats don't go that fast.  The photo in the ad with the airboat lifting is not what happens.  Also the airboat does not go over grass.  The entire ride was about a mile and the boat stayed in open water.We saw 2 alligators.  They stuck their heads out of the water and the boat got within 10 feet for photos. The boat turned around so both sides could get photos. The excessive begging for tips by the captain made us uncomfortable.The show after the ride was pretty lame.  The highlight was a Gator Boy putting a sluggish alligator's jaw under his chin.  He criticized the crowd for not applauding.  After the show, the animal encounter 'zoo' is only three tiny cages with a pig, raccoons and a turtle.

We sat on the edge of the boat but i dont think it would have been as good an eperience for those in the center seats! TIP: get a seat on the side! They are very organized and when you purchase your ticket you are given a number which they call out on a loud speaker when your boat is ready - bet to the line up when you hear the number before yours so that you are first in line for your boat and can get a side seat! the Aligator show afterwards was good.... we only caught the end of the show because of the ting when our boat arrived back and we couldnt wait for the next one to start because of another engagement... but  i thoroughly enjoyed the part i did see and took about 50 photos. Tip again would be to make sure you are one of the first in to the show (even wait for the next show if you can) because visibility is not easy if you are behind others and if you have little ones you will need to lift them up! All in all - i would recommend this tour and facility to others no problem!!","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Mar 2014 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.338764Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T16:21:30.366315Z","inner_id":222,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1940,"annotations":[{"id":224,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":36,"end":59,"text":"show you the Everglades","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"VFzrhCqEGc","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":61,"end":77,"text":"Very informative","labels":["educational"]},"id":"QMWQtP6jSC","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-03T16:24:15.923328Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T16:24:15.923328Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-03T16:24:15.195759Z","lead_time":165.342,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"5555cc03-5ac2-4db2-bbbe-95cc358b564b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1940,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"FRANK M","user_hometown":"4 contributions","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Boat Captain Rick","content":"Absolutely the best boat captain to show you the Everglades!

We finally got told to go and join the queue for the alligator show.  This was good and quite entertaining, however there were numerous references made about having to leave a tip as it was an unpaid job??  We then left this and had our photo taken with a baby Alligator.  Following this we left for the airboat ride.  This was good fun and we got to take a few photos despite not seeing much wildlife (to be expected).  The guide again went on a few times about leaving a tip and stating how much he wanted.  We left the boat unable to leave a tip to then be publicly humiliated.  Now let me be clear.  This excursion was NOT free.  We paid good money for this.  We were due to fly home that evening and had run out of cash.  We always tip when we have a good service as we know this is expected in the states but this place just expects it and will humiliate you if you don’t tip.

It was a bit disconcerting.  The alligators were a bit peeved that we got too close and one just swam away to avoid us, and seeing that an airboat was coming up to them ever 15 min, I could see why. I felt bad for them and the fact they were basically being harassed in their home. The alligator show was, well, strange. A guy who called himself an alligator wrestler made some really silly and sometimes off colour jokes while he waited for the bleachers to fill up for the show. Some of the comments I didn't think were too appropriate but he continued. He pulled one reluctant alligator over to the sand pit and opened the alligator's mouth, put his face in it and that was about it for the event of his acrobatics. He didn't really talk much about the conservation or protection of the animals so I felt like it was a not well thought out show. We did get to see and pet a baby alligator named Loki and have our picture taken with her for about 10 sec before having to duck away back to the buses. The one thing that was a bit of a downer, was that it seemed everyone was asking, repeatedly, for tips. I know many folks in these types of jobs work with lower pay and rely on tips, but when we're reminded multiple times and there are signs everywhere telling us, it becomes a bit frustrating. And not all of us carry cash anymore, so being made to feel like idiots because we didn't tip the person wasn't a pleasant experience. Considering how expensive the shop items were, $4.00 for a small bottle of water, I'd assume they paid the employees better by this point. Guess not. It wasn't a bad way to spend an afternoon, just wasn't fabulous.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/11\/32\/89\/60\/tip-sign-on-airboat.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Oct 2017 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.338764Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T17:31:57.430075Z","inner_id":232,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1950,"annotations":[{"id":234,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":40,"end":62,"text":"Tons of animals to see","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"xQXtt-8tyL","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":121,"end":139,"text":"close up to gators","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"ybcvfopQtF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-03T17:33:51.647948Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:08:10.305914Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-03T17:33:21.617027Z","lead_time":114.775,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"b5189296-1f85-4b93-9a24-fd52dbe21ce8","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1950,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Tink","user_hometown":"Sunrise, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Fun for all!","content":"Airboat a must!

We then got the chance for a photo with a baby alligator, a quick look around the gift shop and John dropped us back.Highly highly recommend this to everyone.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/0d\/53\/d0\/58\/imag0637-largejpg.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Oct 2016 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.338764Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T19:26:42.934647Z","inner_id":245,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1963,"annotations":[{"id":247,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":15,"end":57,"text":"see what the Florida Everglades looks like","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"U2pFt90wUe","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":62,"end":115,"text":"experience an hour long ride in an Everglades Airboat","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"jhA0YBj9Wa","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":265,"end":311,"text":"seeing Alligators, Osprey, Hawks, and Iguana's","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"sBmzVTWdy4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":351,"end":387,"text":"talk about this trip for a life time","labels":["existence"]},"id":"t0wYszyR9p","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-03T19:41:00.650250Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T19:41:00.651251Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-03T19:40:33.588823Z","lead_time":857.506,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"200341b5-57b8-43a6-848b-6181fe3e675e","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1963,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Curtis S","user_hometown":"Tallahassee, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Airboat Ride in the Florida Everglades","content":"If you want to see what the Florida Everglades looks like and experience an hour long ride in an Everglades Airboat then this is the place to come.Well worth the money it costs for the trip of a lifetime.Took my Wife and her Friend here to experience the thrill of seeing Alligators, Osprey, Hawks, and Iguana's all on the same trip.Your friends will talk about this trip for a life time.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/ed\/e6\/b2\/airboat-captian-manuvers.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/ed\/e6\/aa\/this-is-the-power-plants.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/ed\/e6\/ae\/airboat-captian-showing.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Feb 2018 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.338764Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T19:41:00.693070Z","inner_id":246,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1964,"annotations":[{"id":248,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-03T19:41:17.112247Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T19:41:17.112247Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":16.217,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"9e4b6684-761e-486a-839b-1dbc5494a7c9","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1964,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Stueei","user_hometown":"1 contribution","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great Experience!!","content":"We had such a great day!!

You are getting an up close look at the Everglades, a wildlife preserve about 20 minutes outside the center of Ft. Lauderdale.  Airboat tours and rides are offered daily from 9 a.m. until dark. Your trip starts with a airboat ride through the surrounding wetlands and it is a thrill when the captain opens up the throttle and the boat is skimming over the water at 55 MPH. During the hour long ride you are introduced to the various forms of wildlife and are constantly looking for alligators. We spotted three on our ride but the big one, Bubba, was no where to be found. After our airboat ride we were entertained at the gator show in the \"gator pit\" and got to hold a baby alligator at the end. You not only view alligators in their own natural habitat but are taught about their health and wellbeing. Included in general admission is a free picture taken before you board the airboat which is a nice token to bring home. A gift shop is on the premises as well as a small cafe for beverages and light snacks. For an additional fee, bus pick ups can be arranged at the various hotels in Ft. Lauderdale. It is best to arrive early and avoid the crowds and heat.Check out the web site for Everglades Holiday Park for money saving coupons.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Dec 2016 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.354275Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T00:24:19.472357Z","inner_id":259,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1977,"annotations":[{"id":261,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T00:24:44.289439Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T00:24:44.289439Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":24.562,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"7f04eea4-e466-4470-b871-72a64fc113f7","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1977,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Andrea L","user_hometown":"Austin, TX","rating":"1.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Terrible, don’t do it!!!","content":"This place is the worst, completely disorganized, messy, no signs, information or employees to answer questions.

We watched from the ramp through the fence, but I wish we had gone all the way down in front because those fences were dropped down at the tops just before the show started and those people had a better view.  There were 12 gators in the enclosure and \"gator girl\" pulled a 200-pounder out of the water by his tail to do the show.

We drove from the port after debarkation and it was about a 45 minute drive. We arrived around 11-11:30 and it was fairly busy, but not crowded. We purchased our tickets and then waited for our group to be called. There is plenty to look at and plenty of seats while you wait. There is a small gift shop, convenience type store and a little food window. Our group was called about 15 mins later, we lined up and each family had their photo taken in front of a boat before entering. At the end of the tour we were able to buy that along with a key chain for $10. Our boat driver was very knowledgeable & funny and made the trip fun. The scenery is beautiful and we saw plenty of gators. After the air boat tour we followed the crowd to the gator wrestling show, it gets very packed in that small area so try to find a good spot quickly. Since my son & his dad are huge fans of the show Gator Boys, they were hoping to see one of the guys featured on the show. But instead Ashley Lawrence from the show was working with the gators that day and they were just as pleased seeing her ;). The show lasted about 15 mins and then you can have pics taken with a small gator if you'd like. Glad we stopped here, it was a nice and we all enjoyed it.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5c\/ab\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5c\/b8\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5c\/c1\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5c\/d7\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5c\/fc\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5d\/12\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5d\/24\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5d\/3b\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5d\/4d\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5d\/62\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5d\/71\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5d\/81\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/06\/22\/5d\/9f\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Oct 2013 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T01:13:00.421468Z","inner_id":276,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1994,"annotations":[{"id":278,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":24,"end":36,"text":"saw 3 gators","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"yQuIjlAhdK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":73,"end":84,"text":"ride on Taz","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"NoFHU9ou5t","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T01:16:56.801356Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T01:16:56.801356Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-04T01:13:37.465275Z","lead_time":236.172,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"203056b6-4897-40f7-a9fb-4f25ad3e8764","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1994,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"cagalindo","user_hometown":"Orlando, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great tour, saw gators, interesting tour guide","content":"This place delivers.

We saw a few aquatic plants, buzzards sitting in a tree, tiny birds skipping across the water plants and spent most our time looking for a gator. Finally located a 4 foot gator swimming away from us toward vegetation cover.After the boat ride I was hopeful the Gator Boys show and the gift shop would rescue this trip. Neither did. The gator show was made up of dragging a lethargic gator away from the fence and jumping on its' back. The \"gator 'rassler\" pulled the gator's snout up and placed it under his chin, then he did the \"face off\" move and that was it. In all, the gator show lasted maybe 10 minutes.If you're going here expecting to see one of the TV stars don't gamble your whole trip on that or you will probably be disappointed.In hindsight I wish I had considered one of the other Everglades adventures.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jun 2013 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T01:24:23.442247Z","inner_id":281,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1999,"annotations":[{"id":283,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":110,"end":198,"text":"saw 6 alligators in their natural habitat as well as a variety of birds, fish and plants","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"hnDVskhpAC","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T01:24:34.182099Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T01:24:34.182099Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":10.332,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"81ee1f4f-8494-42ef-be07-afacf2fc167d","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1999,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"CREED2013","user_hometown":"Nacogdoches, TX","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Fun and informative!","content":"Captain Cody was very knowledgeable and had a great sense of humor.

No more - just about ANYWHERE is nicer. If you think you're going to come here and \"see some alligators\" they're not going to let that happen without you forking over some dough for the air boat ride. ALL the gators are kept behind screening and you only get to see the gators and wrestling show if you buy an air boat ticket. What if you can't take the air boat? Too bad. My son is in a wheelchair and the vibration of the boat would threaten his medical condition. When I told them we couldn't do the air boat the response was that was the only way they do it. Thankfully, as we were walking away a kind employee who overheard me slipped us a piece of paper allowing us to get into the \"show\" which is the only place you can see the gators. The \"show\" is a 10 minute \"wrestling\" match where someone talks about the gators and does a couple tricks with them. It's okay but nothing incredible. Seeing how we got into the show for free we made sure to give the presenter (his name was Chris - a tall blond guy) a $10 tip and then paid the $5 to take a picture with the baby alligator. I asked Chris if he minded if we took his picture as well and he gave the most sarcastic and condescending, \"wow, I can't think of anything more fun\". He said he has been on the Animal Planet show a few times (he's not one of the main guys and I didn't recognize him) so maybe he thinks celebrities are supposed to act arrogant (I felt a little embarrassed for him). Nevertheless, there are MUCH better options out there from Billy Swamp to even just driving through Alligator Alley and looking out the window. I can't really speak regarding the air boat (there are tons of them around anyway) but this place went from something fun and cool to something sad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Feb 2013 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T01:43:02.581935Z","inner_id":291,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2009,"annotations":[{"id":293,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":88,"end":110,"text":"saw quite a few gators","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"lMJxqUZRhu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T01:43:08.918036Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T01:43:08.918036Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":6.116,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"f9b58585-6dfe-4c18-9831-9e796f840ba8","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2009,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Brian N","user_hometown":"Indianapolis, IN","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Fun","content":"Great experience.

Everyone was so friendly and knowledgeable.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/cd\/35\/9d\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/cd\/35\/df\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/cd\/36\/0a\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/cd\/36\/39\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/cd\/36\/53\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/cd\/36\/6c\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/cd\/36\/c7\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Apr 2014 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T01:48:59.819677Z","inner_id":296,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2014,"annotations":[{"id":298,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":15,"end":36,"text":"take an air boat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"U0gJHGGYD6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":211,"end":221,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"tCaGXaUdcP","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T01:50:01.416019Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T01:50:01.416019Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-04T01:49:31.319818Z","lead_time":61.382,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"873bdb35-0294-4412-a37a-22fd9494b1be","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2014,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Princerman","user_hometown":"Otsego, MN","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"This place is cool","content":"I've wanted to take an air boat ride for a long time.

GA","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"One of a kind experience","content":"Everglades Holiday Park is South Florida's premier gateway to the state's most exciting natural attraction-the Everglades. The park started nearly three decades ago by George M. Bridges who build the first airboat by hand in his backyard in 1982. The park is a family fun entertainment destinations and offers everything from guided Everglades airboat tours and live alligator presentations to food, souvenirs and fresh water fishing,A moms review:Visiting the Everglades has been on my, \"places to visit list\" for a very long time. So when we received an opportunity to review Everglades Holiday Park during our visit to Florida I just had to say yes. Everglades Holiday Park is located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida so it took us about 3 1\/2 hours to get there from the Orlando area but the drive was well worth it.We arrived at the park around 11 am. Parking was plentiful and it was very easy to locate the gift shop where we received our airboat tour ticket. The gift shop was quite large and offered snacks, souvenirs and fishing gear. There were well maintained restrooms located just outside of the gift shop. There was also a deli located next to the gift shop in case you need to grab a bite to eat. After receiving our airboat tour tickets we went outside to sit on the covered porch in front of the gift shop to wait for our tour number to be called. In about 10 minutes they announced our tour number over the PA system and we proceeded down to the boat dock.Once at the boat dock a staff member gathered our family and took a souvenir photo. And guess what the photo is included in the cost of your tickets! How cool is that? No need to pay another $20+ for a photo to remember your experience.At this point the kids were getting really excited.....okay so was I. Our Captain walked us up the dock to the boat and we piled in. The boats seat 20+ people and are covered so you don't have to worry about melting in the Florida sun! After our Captain Mike went over some rules we were off on our 60 minute thrilling airboat tour of the Everglades.WOW! We learned so much in 60 minutes. Mike told us the history of the area, how the Native Americans lived off the land, and how to survive if you ever get lost in the Everglades (which I hope never happens...eek). He also showed us the numerous flora and fauna of the area and yes we did get to see a couple alligators...one of them was only a few feet away from the boat! Our Captain really made our experience a fun and remarkable one. It is one that we will never forget. He was funny, informative and you could tell he was very dedicated to his job. **Important note: bring cash to tip your airboat Captain and the Gator Boys that do the presentation...they deserve it. The Everglades Holiday Park airboat experience is perfect for all ages and a must for nature enthusiasts, thrill seekers and artists!After our airboat tour we picked up our souvenir photo and headed up to the waiting area for our gator show with the famous \"Gator Boys\"! If you don't know who the Gator Boys are let me tell you a little bit about them. The Gator Boys are a group of people (and not just boys there is a woman too) dedicated to rescuing nuisance alligators around Florida. Their reality show airs on Animal Planet, in fact many of their episodes were filmed at Everglades Holiday Park. When it was time for our show they walked us down to a covered walkway located in front of the \"gator pit.\" **Important note: Everglades Holiday Park is in the process of building an arena area for future shows! The 20 minute show is an adrenalin-charged good time filled with exciting stunts, tricks and some of the best entertainment around. It is also very educational which is a plus for our homeschooling family! The show is very animal friendly and in fact the Gator Boys Alligator Rescue actually helps nuisance alligators by giving them a place to live and eat in a natural setting. These gators, if not rescued would have been euthanized...instead they are now animal ambassadors helping to break down alligator stereotypes!After the show is over you can head over to the photo area to capture some more special memories. For a small fee you can get a memorable experience and photo holding a baby alligator, snake or other critter (animals do vary but they generally always have a baby alligator available for a photo shoot). Look at their grins. They were in absolute heaven.We give Everglades Holiday Park 5 stars. The cost, experiences and staff were all stellar. We highly recommend this experience to any family looking for a one of a kind way to spend their time in Florida! I promise you will not be disappointed. When I posted our photos to social media several followers told me they had similar experiences with Everglades Holiday Park and visit every year when they vacation in Florida!","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jun 2016 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T01:58:22.841137Z","inner_id":298,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2016,"annotations":[{"id":300,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":152,"end":186,"text":"Saw an alligator in the Everglades","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"FJFFIlKo96","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":196,"end":208,"text":"airboat tour","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"iGl-JzJj6t","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":257,"end":271,"text":"Alligator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"BLovq8qN8p","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":135,"end":150,"text":"gator boys show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"k37AWZo5UN","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T01:59:22.639147Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T01:59:22.639147Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-04T01:59:04.026527Z","lead_time":46.722,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"c79b2960-1c2c-4673-8e32-f16ac2ddab80","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2016,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Njpsychnurse","user_hometown":"65 contributions","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Fun fun fun!","content":"Remarkable!

Many people thought they was in line in the order they arrived to boarding while others kept walking up after and placing themselves to board ahead those already waiting. Yes we was among one of those that was cut.In speaking with others that had frequented Holiday they said this action is normal and that they had seen verbal exchanges in the past over this lack of courtesy.

When you get there you must buy a ticket for the air boat ride and to get in the show ( about 30 dollars for adult). we waited for about 30 minutes. they take your picture before you get on the boat. Can be purchased after the boat ride. we did came out great (10 dollars). The air boat ride for us lasted about 1 hour. We saw alligators in a few different spots. Each boat driver seems to have its own bet bird out in the everglades. When you stop it hopped right on his arm when he came and sat in the seating area on the boat. we were within 3 feet of two alligators (cool). The show was with one of the gator boys on the show he did a very nice job. It lasts about 20 minutes. You can even hold a baby alligator if you want for a $5 dollar donation to the alligator rescue part of the park.

Having done other air boat tours, I do not recommend this one.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/21\/b9\/3b\/b6\/caption.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/21\/b9\/3b\/b7\/caption.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/21\/b9\/3b\/b8\/caption.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:09:18.148954Z","inner_id":312,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2030,"annotations":[{"id":314,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":1989,"end":2016,"text":"see local birds and turtles","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"K2CU3nLTKN","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2028,"end":2043,"text":"snakes and fish","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"bytw0krI27","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2069,"end":2098,"text":"\"gator and swamp\" experiences","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"j03dZ6dxdT","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":325,"end":337,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"k_yo45WJkI","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1561,"end":1601,"text":"dike along the Eastern edge of the swamp","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"lZEN0ZICHb","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1643,"end":1691,"text":"look out over this part of the conservation area","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"al1wGj1BQ6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1801,"end":1820,"text":"an \"Indian Village\"","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"KULf9k0Igo","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1860,"end":1902,"text":"local alligators hang around in the canals","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"Vl3ugH9JAI","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1372,"end":1408,"text":"see the northern views of the Glades","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"gvo-VxhlRw","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1226,"end":1245,"text":"a County campground","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"jZ_jywWING","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T14:36:23.205094Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T14:36:23.205094Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-04T02:30:00.690081Z","lead_time":43817.829,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"76123c7a-ddd4-4c4a-a743-7b3ead7791c5","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2030,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"DPB123","user_hometown":"Weston, FL","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Good Way to take a Peak at the Glades","content":"Holiday Park is just a few miles from the house and is a regular stop when we have guests that want to see the a small part of the Everglades Conservation Area. This not part of the Everglades National Park, but it is still very cool to see. Visits here are safe and clean and perfect for the casual visit with or without an airboat ride. This is much better choice for a quick visit than any other point farther north. Just like everything else around here, the place has changed a lot over the past ten years. Today, the \"bait and beer\" shop is gone, and the air boat fleet is huge. Most of the fishing trips have moved to other ramps and docks because the place is really busy now. The tourists arrive by the busload when cruise ships are in port so the parking lot is actually paved now. The County has taken over the operation so it is a lot cleaner than it probably ever has been. Parents don't need to worry any more about having their small children grabbed by one of the toothless gator poachers that used to hang around the main building while living in one of the of the derelict trailers on the property. All of that junk has been removed from behind the main building, and the entire area is being converted into a County campground.  Now that reality TV shows use the area, it is really tame and family oriented. For tourists, this is a fast and easy way to see the northern views of the Glades. The short drive in is along one of the main flood control canals and a major pumping station sits at the end of the canal next to the parking lot. The dike along the Eastern edge of the swamp has a road on top and from there you can look out over this part of the conservation area. Most of the airboat drivers do a good job of informing and entertaining guests. The trip includes a stop at an \"Indian Village\" which is cheesy, but kids love it. The local alligators hang around in the canals to make sure everybody gets to see one of them unless it gets cold. Most trips get to see local birds and turtles, sometimes snakes and fish. This is one of the best \"gator and swamp\" experiences in the State. It is very accessible with good facilities and can usually handle the crowds. If you want to feel as if you went out to convene with nature, but still wanted to be within 10 miles of the nearest Starbucks, this is the place.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jul 2016 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T14:36:23.249099Z","inner_id":313,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2031,"annotations":[{"id":315,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":281,"end":299,"text":"see the alligators","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"FUrwwIbs2P","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":309,"end":337,"text":"got in the water next to one","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"LIT_b0Zu-K","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":203,"end":254,"text":"negotiate his way through the thunder and lightning","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"20cbjI0iin","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":360,"end":370,"text":"Great ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"q96VyK9p8H","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":430,"end":449,"text":"The show at the end","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"WphMT1-YS7","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":478,"end":493,"text":"500lb alligator","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"4Qa76EkfSs","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T14:45:24.971873Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T14:45:24.971873Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-04T14:41:42.058829Z","lead_time":541.485,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"1e979a87-c0d2-481f-85f0-93223f1531cb","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2031,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Fergus R","user_hometown":"Northwich, UK","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great family experience!","content":"Visited this in August and had a great few hours.

We were met bak at the dock by all the captains who weren't giving tours at that time. This was not a welcome back for us but it was for our guide. She received her Captain's hat and rather than being covered with champagne, they soaked her with bottled water.The \" Gator Boys\" are from an \"Animal Planet\" show.

First, we had the greatest animal encounter session with Jessica! We were only 3 couples, so we felt really good taken care of! She taught us a lot about the animals she showed us- the raccoon, the tortoise, the BROWN AND WHITE SCUNK! (I thought they only came in black\/white), a tiny alligator and last but not least the snake, which I was afraid of at first, but it was so calm and well behaving that all my fears (almost) vanished! Jessica was a lot of fun too, she had many both good and bad jokes, but mainly many interesting facts - she knew her stuff! We got to hold all animals except the raccoon, as they are picky lovers and we didn't hold the tortoise either, but she walked around, so we had out chance to touch her.Next off, we har a boat ride with Captain Robert, who did a very lively telling as we went about the rivers. He told us about the seagrass, the peppercorns, the yellow lilly, the vultures and generally all the edibles in the area. At first we didn't see any alligators, as it had been raining that morning, and gators go under water in rainy weather. We were in luck, though! Captain Rob went out of his was, going off route to show us just one gator he had seen earlier- and we were in luck! There was a female alligator! She wasn't very big, but we got some nice shots and Captain Rob made sure to turn the boat around a few times to make sure everyone had a good chance to see her!As we went further, we saw another gator and a bit after that, Captain Rob sounded like he was going crazy! Shouting about a HUGE gator and none of us saw anything! Then he turned the boat around, and surely, there it was! It was massive! So impressive! And it sorta chased the boat around, so that was both exciting and worrying! It came really close! Amazing experience! Last but not least, we saw the gator show! We were very impressed with how the Gator Boy (we're sorry, we don't remember your name!) He just walked into the gator pit like he owned the place and talked about the different alligators in there, lifted the tail of the biggest one in there, which was just as big as him - the tail, that is!! Very impressive! He also had some both good and bad jokes, but most importantly, he put on a good show, showed us the mouth of the gator and pulled off some daring tricks!

We learned many things about these animals and gained a lot of respect for them all for their individual intelligence and traits.  Very memorable. Thanks to Emilio and the photographer lady.  They take a lot of pictures as a part of the encounter.  (at no charge) The airboat tour is great and fun for the entire family.  We were an arms length from the gators.

The Alligator show was very nice and professional and it is good to see that they take care of them pretty well. The two free photos is an added bonus. If you are in the military ask for discount I got 50% off of my ticket.  The only reason I did not give five stars is because they say ear protection is included but none was given.

This trip was a 180 from that experience.  We rode in a covered boat; if you were in the middle of the seating bench you were not able to see much.

At no time did I fear for the presenter's safety which I thought was kind of the idea.  it wasn't a horrible experience, just kind of a let down because I was really looking forward to this!","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Dec 2013 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:01:50.149714Z","inner_id":357,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2075,"annotations":[{"id":359,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T19:59:20.949643Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:10:23.497360Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":9.870999999999999,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"20e00f54-7ba8-4159-b87d-f9fe2ec168c3","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2075,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Richard S","user_hometown":"Bratislava, Slovakia","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Airboat with Ricky","content":"Airboat with Ricky is really the best experience in Park, try to get him to be your captain, you will not regret","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jan 2022 • Solo","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:10:23.564806Z","inner_id":358,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2076,"annotations":[{"id":360,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":182,"end":203,"text":"saw at least 5 gators","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"-4TRsZAdLj","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":205,"end":261,"text":"some were really called out of the bushes by the captain","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"NhuFXBKQLZ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":370,"end":394,"text":"holding a baby alligator","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"c8h0SkGHOZ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":405,"end":409,"text":"show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"gz0WkTxzdw","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":308,"end":339,"text":"taking and giving you a picture","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"NDNBRcyX99","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T20:00:48.792378Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T20:00:48.792378Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-04T19:59:44.516058Z","lead_time":83.508,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"2cc2d221-acf0-47d3-98ce-fb53aede47c1","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2076,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"drrmlipp2","user_hometown":"Lake Worth, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Fabulous experience","content":"This is my second time to this property, a different experience, from first time.

I doubt the feeding(unless its birds) is still taking place today, given the large size of the airboats the guides do make an effort to reposition them so everyone can get a good view.   The gator show is included as part of your airboat tour, I suggest keeping a close eye on groupon and saving some money that way. The show Gator Boys may be drawing in some people who otherwise wouldnt come out this way and although I didnt see the primary stars of the show, one of the secondary characters was there giving a show.

We chose this one since it was a shorter time (about 45 min bus ride) to the Everglades and  lower priced than some others. I felt like we got our money's worth on it and enjoyed the afternoon. The everglades boat tour was interesting, our guide did a nice job explaining the ecology of the region and pointing out alligators and other wildlife. The only downside was there was one staff person who was quite abrupt and rude telling people to get in line. She acted like we were an inconvenience to her. We had to wait in the sun instead of the shade just a few feet away. We were the first ones in line from our group and still there was no smiling or conversation, just bossing and directing us around. Then other groups were taken ahead of us. The store with souvenirs was good - i found a cute t-shirt for my son. Staff there was pleasant and helpful. There was also a cafe on the grounds and it smelled good although we didn't order any food.. The alligator show was fine. The 'gator boy' guy who led it talked a fair amount about how the alligators arrive there and how much they care for them but there wasn't a whole lot of interaction with them. He did get ahold of one and do a few tricks holding its mouth, etc. which was impressive. I wouldn't want to be in that tank! Then it was mostly a plea for more money to support their organization. There was then a small series of pens with other animals - a pig, raccoons, and a baby alligator (which we got to see and touch but not hold since we weren't buying the additional $10 photo).","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Oct 2017 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:02:00.898032Z","inner_id":369,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2087,"annotations":[{"id":371,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":53,"end":71,"text":"told about a snake","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"YEj9_O6jF0","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":99,"end":117,"text":"see many alligator","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"3lgv7LdtU8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T20:11:49.413038Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T20:11:49.413038Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-04T20:11:47.001784Z","lead_time":17.45,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"bda2cd8b-ad35-4c18-8aae-a4f99b8e27db","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2087,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"thekeysfans","user_hometown":"Hyannis, MA","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Fun!","content":"It was so beautiful and interesting.

Princess offers a disembarkation tour to the Everglades Holiday Park with drop off at the Fort Lauderdale airport by noon. Getting off the ship was quick and efficient. After picking up our luggage, we were shown to a bus and our luggage was loaded. Very interesting guide told us all about Ft. Lauderdale and the Everglades as we drove. Clean bus, comfortable seats, huge windows. Arriving at the Everglades Holiday Park, we went first to see the Gator Boys Alligator show, a close up view behind a chain link fence where the Gator guy talked as he demonstrated some \"tricks\" with a feisty alligator, very entertaining, my 8 yr. old grandson loved it. Great photo ops or they would take your photo holding a small alligator. Well stocked gift shop and food was sold next door. We were then led down to the dock where airboats were taking off on 30 minute tours. We were aboard the Looney, with Captain Mike as the operator. Mike was very knowledgable about the gators and the Everglades in general. We cruised fast to show what the airboat could do and then very slowly into reedy areas where Mike knew the gators to hang out. Sure enough, we sighted 4 and Mike described their habits and even told us names he had given them and some alligator cultural and folk tales. At one place, Mike called out for Grumpy and out he came, swam right out alongside our boat and seemed to recognize Mike's voice. Really interesting and fun but too short. If you go, try to allow enough time for the one hour airboat ride and be sure to see the free one man gator show. Observed small bus in the parking lot with a sign that you could arrange pickups from your hotel. All in all, highly recommend that if you are in Miami\/Ft. Lauderdale vicinity, make time to experience the Everglades. Price is reasonable, park is clean, ship operators do an awesome job in a short time. Be sure to wear sunscreen and a hat since the sun is blazing hot year round.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/0a\/ff\/fb\/0d\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Apr 2016 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T20:31:42.321367Z","inner_id":389,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2107,"annotations":[{"id":391,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":32,"end":58,"text":"see alligators in the wild","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"uE8E_YkYq4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":64,"end":76,"text":"saw 3-4 ones","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"-vekk7HduJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":82,"end":96,"text":"speedboat trip","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"EHD8Mw8kO-","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":190,"end":194,"text":"ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"h4MiJfM51g","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":240,"end":254,"text":"alligator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"kCAAOp5EJ9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":280,"end":324,"text":"there are many gators rescued by this center","labels":["bequest"]},"id":"UMqegeRYYp","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":326,"end":425,"text":"The man puts his face into the mouth of an alligator and shows how fast they can bite with his hand","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"Bt8S4_aWl6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":449,"end":478,"text":"a picture with a living gator","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"IzuSZYaq4V","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T20:32:38.517561Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T20:32:38.517561Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-04T20:31:58.321255Z","lead_time":55.971,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"f60d3dc2-d93e-4cf5-9525-d21393cf3125","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2107,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"YvonneK474","user_hometown":"Braunschweig, Germany","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Gators in the wild!","content":"You ride on a speedboat and can see alligators in the wild...we saw 3-4 ones.

He told them of their habitat and put his head in the gators mouth.  After... for just $5.00 you can hold a baby alligator.  Now for a 8 year old this is the greatest wildlife experience.   After that we  visited the gift shop and feed the peacocks which roomed wild in area.   We then went to the dock to take the airboat ride.  First you wait for a photographer to take you picture.  When our turn arrived,  I asked if our boat captain could join us.  We had a great picture taken of our group facing the sun.  As we border our Captain introduced himself as Mike and welcomed us.  We then took off and and it was fun to ride through the marsh like waters and see the sun sparkling off the water. The captain then stopped and told us to look to our left where there was a group of birds perched in some trees Mike was very knowledgeable of the wildlife and the vegetation. I even learned a few things. He also show my granddaughter a tree gator which then the entire boat woooo'd at the site.  When we seen the alligators Mike mad a couple of turnabouts for people to get the best shot with their cameras.  He also sat in the boat with us for a short while and told us some history of the everglades made a few joke and made it a point to remember some of our names.   When retuning to the dock he thanked us for coming and offered his hand to help us onto the dock. If you do not know what a tree gator is and you would like to see one, you have to take this airboat ride.We had a great time.

If you go, plan on staying there for longer than expected, and park farther than the map shows online as the parking lot is closed due to construction. Overall though - the creatures made it worthwhile and fun for all ages.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Feb 2021","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.355806Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:11:13.311676Z","inner_id":399,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2117,"annotations":[{"id":401,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":160,"end":185,"text":"see the fauna and animals","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"aZyYxH2HVu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":441,"end":462,"text":"hold a baby alligator","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"QjwPn6WQZF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":82,"end":95,"text":"air boat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"jgvJ5GEuyH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":232,"end":261,"text":"jetted across the open spaces","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"qXZi6o0hcE","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":264,"end":327,"text":"Lots of natural beauty with verbalization of what one is seeing","labels":["existence"]},"id":"rDW5BFauK3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":507,"end":517,"text":"Boat photo","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"npnTIYRlvY","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":334,"end":344,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"0pj3b4D6P7","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T20:43:53.466948Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T20:43:53.466948Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-04T20:42:53.778724Z","lead_time":89.729,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"2497b000-73f2-47cd-ae90-e71e3e6f0e8a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2117,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"LAURIE S","user_hometown":"Buckhannon, WV","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Action and adventure","content":"Facility has plenty to do and offers military discounts but you have to ask.

Jessica at Animal Encounters was very informative about the animals in her care, and we were able to hold a young alligator, a boa, and a chubby brown and white skunk.  We were also able to pet an opossum.  The brown and white skunk was new to me, the others I've already encountered in my lifetime, but this time was a pleasure.Our airboat ride was a blast.  Captain Chaos, the Alligator Whisperer, found cute little Bunny.  She came swimming toward the boat and swam around showing the length of her body and smiling.  Someone mentioned, in another review, that the gator was obviously a robotic fake, if he was on our boat, I wish he had tried to pet her.  They're wild animals, not robots.  No one can control where and how many may be seen.  To see one in the wild was fantastic.  The iguanas were amazing, so many large males sunning on rocks or sleeping in the trees.  The birds were beautiful, some that I've only seen in pictures.  Even Vulture Island was fun to see, with those big guys just roosting up in the trees.  Flowering trees and water plants all serving their purpose to keep the everglades and their inhabitants healthy and well-fed.  Loud motors, yes, they're loud, but not ear-splitting.  How loud do you turn up your car radio for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" or \"We Are The Champions\"?  There ya go.  Thank you, Captain Chaos for an enjoyable, interesting, and safe ride.  Your passion and love of the Everglades is so apparent and infectious.On to the Gator Show.  Paul's jokes were good, not corny, the information priceless.  If I ever meet up with a gator, I'll know that he really doesn't want to hurt me and I can turn and run like hell.  On the way out there is a clear box for donations to help with the preservation of these amazingly beautiful animals.  Please help the cause and leave something.  The Captains deserve good tips also, they're doing their best to give you a great adventure.I guess you could say I enjoyed the few hours I spent yesterday.  Thanks to Captain Chaos and also to Captain KC (female Captain) for introducing me to Everglades Holiday Park.  I will forever be their cheerleader.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Dec 2018 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.373401Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T21:18:31.324050Z","inner_id":413,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2131,"annotations":[{"id":415,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T21:19:13.008312Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T21:19:13.008312Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":36.12,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"14b5aa04-2601-4e4c-b89e-2f1840121786","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2131,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Shelby T","user_hometown":"1 contribution","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"ALWAYS A MUST!","content":"I’m local and every time I have visitors I bring them here.

The giant snakes also take down deer and hogs, but populations of these two mammals so far seem able to sustain this culling. There are non-native fish in the Everglades waters, our pilot said. He mentioned a huge piranha that had been caught by a fisherman. Various birds, on the water, in the air, in trees, were pointed out to us. Even though I hail from south Florida, this airboat ride\/tour was most informative.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/08\/05\/54\/8d\/airboat.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/08\/05\/b7\/e9\/flood-control-pumping.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Sep 2014 • Solo","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.373401Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T21:29:45.024706Z","inner_id":426,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2144,"annotations":[{"id":428,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":5,"end":14,"text":"boat tour","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"FrpqZPg4Zq","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T21:29:51.629242Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T21:29:51.629242Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":6.384,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"9cc93355-dc18-4a87-b39e-fd594ead8504","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2144,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Kim W","user_hometown":"Hinsdale, IL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Last minute","content":"This boat tour was awesome.

We were told that they rescue gators that are in places that they shouldn't be for free and bring them back to the park. The area contained about 25 gators, the water looked dirty and the space was small. A girl went into the area, pulled out a gator and did a couple of daring things with it (i.e. the face off move where she opened the gators mouth and put her chin on top of the gators nose). After this, you can have a picture taken with a snake or a baby gator (that has electrical tape around its mouth :( I didn't like this part. The workers also say that due to the high-risk nature of their jobs that they don't get paid and constantly ask for tips. There is a restaurant on-site as well as a gift shop. You do get one complimentary photo before you enter the air boats. The area where you watch the show as well as the air boats are covered so that you don't bask in the sun.

You are able to take a picture of yourself holding a baby alligator for $5 after the show.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Aug 2014 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.373401Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T23:56:39.776865Z","inner_id":444,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2162,"annotations":[{"id":446,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":228,"end":256,"text":"ripped through the lillypads","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"wLMRwg3PpD","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":369,"end":379,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"1VcKGXR7NU","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T23:57:52.005639Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T23:57:52.005639Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-04T23:57:14.173751Z","lead_time":72.02,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"de617d4e-541d-4ce6-aeb5-40297818ba2f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2162,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Utrocket71","user_hometown":"Toledo, OH","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"A Great Excursion","content":"My wife and I chose this excursion at the end of our Carnival Cruise.

First off, it was the closest park to our hotel in Weston, only about 20 minutes away. It was also one of the cheapest running about $25 for adults. They have an Internet coupon for $3 off as well as a military discount which was 50% off! They had some others like a senior discount, etc. The airboat ride was pretty interesting. It was in a large 30 person airboat so the tour wasn't very personal but the boat had a roof which was really nice to keep our 2 year old out of the sun. The ride was only an hour so there wasn't time to go very far but we did see 2 alligators, 1 small 2 footer and one mom about 8 feet and also got to see her nest of mud which was pretty cool. We also saw a lot of different birds. They had an alligator show after the tour by the gator boys who you may have seen on animal planet. It was interesting and you got to get up close to a bunch of big alligators and touch a little one if you wanted. They did charge for lots of little stuff like a group picture at the airboat ride and to hold the alligator or to sit on one. They also asked for tips and donations but they pretty much earned it. It wasn't the most incredible tour I've ever been on but I can't think of any reason not to give it a 5 of 5.

So us and our young kids did not eat as we thought we were going right on the boat. About 25 minutes later they called our number to go watch the show instead because they were short on captains (we were told by Jeff). So we watched the show which consisted of a woman dragging an alligator out and poking and prodding it (and in our opinion was bordering on abuse of animals that had no interest in being treated that way). Afterwards we waited in line for another 30 minutes after they called our number in cue in front of the boats before we gave up. Hearing that they were loading boat #41 at the same time as ours was the final dagger. We had hungry kids, had been there nearly two hours, and were being shuffled around like cattle. A trip to the office for a refund did not help our opinion of them in any way. RJ was unable to grasp the concept, offered a refund finally (but only partially), and then bizarrely took back the offer of the refund based on the premise that I was rude to him. I have the encounter on video and will be disputing the charges. A wooden sign stating “no refunds” does not absolve them from providing the service they advertised and we paid for.

There was no hint of ANY of the Gator boys any longer except a few photos? I was truly hoping to get to meet or at least see some or even one of them, however I was truly disappointed by the answers I received except from one young lady who I assume told me the sad truth? She said the Gator Boys including Paul Bedard are Never there any more but do make special appearances once in a while? Very sad, as she said since the county took over, they've upgraded and replaced things but were at odds with the Gator Boys inspired Gator saving techniques and ideology? So, they boys and girls of the Gator Boys don't come by very often anymore? I was devastated to hear this and after visiting this wonderful site many times per year until last year when I had some personal issues, I went back and found this out and this was probably my last visit to this once incredible institution!! I love that they rescue and remove nuisance gators or unwanted ones from neighborhood areas and keep them safe to help and hopefully improve our ecosystem in the much needed and endearing Everglades? So, if you want to see a great show and a very nice Airboat tour albeit minus the Gator Boys of old please visit but if you're like me and want to see or meet the old Gator Boys forget it because although when yo contact them they will tell you the Gator boys are almost always there it is their version I guess they are referring to and not the real \"Boys\" of old.

My experience might have been tarnished by the crowds present when we went, but there are things that could have been done by this company to make it so much better. Purchasing our passes here from Trip Advisor several weeks in advance, I mistakenly thought we’d be able to walk in, scan our passes, and jump on an airboat. Instead, when we got there, we discovered a line snaking out of the building and enmeshing itself in a line for the alligator show. Confusion was everywhere. I’m really not sure why they don’t assign you a time window for arrival so that everyone doesn’t come at the same time (which is what might have happened in my case). Furthermore, when after about an hour we finally did get to the ticket window, we discovered a huge part of the slowdown was the pen and paper signatures for liability etc. Why wasn’t this an option online when we made our purchases weeks prior? This would have saved so much time and frustration. I felt like I probably hadn’t even needed to buy my tickets in advance. Lastly, we brought our own water bottles, but discovered there was no place to refill them. This area is hot, and when I asked a staff member if there was a drinking fountain, he said there wasn’t and that the sink water in the bathrooms wasn’t safe to drink. So we were stuck paying $3 per small bottle of water at the little store (where prices are not marked on anything and there is only one overworked employee handling everyone’s purchases).On a positive note, my kids enjoyed seeing some alligators on the airboat tour when it finally happened, but by then they were soured enough on the experience that it just didn’t seem very worth it.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.373401Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T00:35:32.408437Z","inner_id":467,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2185,"annotations":[{"id":469,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":7,"end":51,"text":"see a few gators, birds, and even a few fish","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"lCXE5BQQtD","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-05T00:35:40.565475Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T00:35:40.565475Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.954,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"201d856f-1080-4674-a03e-5cf5d8313877","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2185,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Richard K","user_hometown":"4 contributions","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Family tour","content":"Got to see a few gators, birds, and even a few fish.

The alligator show afterwards likewise was enjoyable and informative,","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jun 2019 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.373401Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T00:49:44.251140Z","inner_id":482,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2200,"annotations":[{"id":484,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":104,"end":127,"text":"Everglades Airboat Tour","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"1pG22FMLxF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":323,"end":342,"text":"see gators close up","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"tnUCTrVvcw","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":369,"end":463,"text":"something of interest was spotted he would swing around the boat so both side were able to see","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"dwWhx7Khgm","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":213,"end":265,"text":"Very informative about the history of the Everglades","labels":["educational"]},"id":"sREl9nEBMT","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":709,"end":719,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"_6V8P58Xrs","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":802,"end":812,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"WzW5OGNu4u","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-05T01:12:44.499145Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:03:32.903378Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-05T01:11:45.605207Z","lead_time":1374.002,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"bc82abda-5bef-47e9-922d-4115d4de94d3","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2200,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Karl F","user_hometown":"Columbus, OH","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"A must do!","content":"I can't say enough positive about the overall experience. Took my two teenage boys along with myself to Everglades Airboat Tour. The cost was well worth the experience. Our tour guide was Dylan, he was fantastic! Very informative about the history of the Everglades and made the tour very fun and exciting. We were able to see gators close up, Dylan made sure whenever something of interest was spotted he would swing around the boat so both side were able to see. Many tourist items are something you do once, just to say you have done it. However this tour was so exciting and well done by the staff, next time in the area we will do this tour again. After the boat tour you will be treated to a 20 minutes gator show hosted by the Gator Boys, also very well done. The staff of both the airboats and gator show do not work for the park, they work for the tips guest provide, so you know they are doing their best you have a good time.

Each family gets at least one side seat.The ride itself is enjoyable. The title actually summarizes the experience, a sneak peak into everglades. It does not take you deep into the everglades reserve. Most of the ride stays within a couple of miles from the starting point. But, you get to experience little bit of this unique ecosystem, get some basic information and get a bit of speeding airboat experience with some \"drifting\".We did see a couple of gators on the ride, a few birds and were informed about the sawgrass.The Gator Show (15 mins) was funny, informative and had little thrill. They also let you take a picture with you holding a baby gator for $5 extra. My son did enjoy the close encounter with the baby gator and its a good photo op.Overall, it is a good introduction to Everglades at a reasonable price.

We saw the ad for Everglades Holiday Park in the local South Florida guide which had a coupon for $3 off adults and $2 off children (who must be 11 and under)The place was packed when we pulled up, full of locals for the fishing and tourists for the taking.  The cost for our family of five was $75 (with coupons, tax, and oldest daughter was considered an adult) for both the one hour airboat tour and the alligator \"wrestling\" show.  Have just come off a cruise, this was one cheap shore excursion (think of it this way, it was $15 pp).  To add to the shore excursion feel of the place, they even took our photo before the tour and offered it for sale for $10 when we returned (we did buy it, it was great looking and $10 5x7 plus a keychain...i.e. we forgot the camera at the hotel!!)The tour was with an old-salt \"I live in the Everglades\" guide who was awesome.  We learned \"a bunch of factual useless stuff\" about the Everglades, enjoyed whipping through the Glades at high speeds and saw three adult alligators, one three year old and one baby less than a foot long.  In addition, we learned about and saw native birds, exotic species and iguanas (big four footers up in the trees!)  Our guide made sure everyone got to see the gators we came across.  Our older daughter, who is highy skeptical of everything, actually enjoyed the tour (red letter day).The alligator demostration afterwards was short, informative and pure old florida tourist trap at its finest.  We absolutely loved it, and tipped generously.This is not for everyone--but for family fun and a nostalgic trip back to the touristy Florida of the fities\/sixties that I could share with my kids--well worth it!","img_urls":"","tour_time":"","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.373401Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T02:25:47.848801Z","inner_id":511,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2229,"annotations":[{"id":513,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":204,"end":217,"text":"air boat tour","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"CJ8kLW4djt","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":428,"end":485,"text":"lots of great stories to tell about the glades and gators","labels":["educational"]},"id":"rBBc7jaRbs","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":490,"end":515,"text":"saw 5 gators on our tour,","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"DwFX2zavCD","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":677,"end":690,"text":"air boat tour","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"Zpg43_O7WH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":699,"end":713,"text":"alligator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"oFou_t3AcY","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":782,"end":800,"text":"alligator wrangler","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"uJjvX4G7zJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":854,"end":897,"text":"dedicated to saving those amazing creatures","labels":["existence"]},"id":"-_ljU5VkNP","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-05T02:27:45.789869Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:03:58.453624Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-05T02:26:32.985012Z","lead_time":119.621,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"8f5b32e3-3d42-4c31-8d12-82bb3ace55b2","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2229,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Carib0906","user_hometown":"Shakopee, MN","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Way fun airboat ride, and a gator boy!","content":"My sister lives in Florida, and I've been talking about the Gator Boys for years.

The boats are configured to reduce noise from the engines and boats weren't overloaded to ensure everyone had a good view. Our captain (I think it was Michael K) was entertaining and had lots of great stories to tell about the glades and gators. We saw 5 gators on our tour, which was good considering that cold weather was moving in and the gators were moving out. And the \"high speed\" straight away areas were exhilarating. After the air boat tour was the alligator show. We were lucky enough to have Paul Bedard of Gator Boys fame as the alligator wrangler. He was funny, talented with Carl the alligator, and dedicated to saving those amazing creatures. He also was so patient with fans, talking to us after the show and taking photos with everyone who asked (including

After we arrived the driver got us our tickets for the air boat tour and we started a new line up to embark the boat.  The driver of the air boat was a young guy they called baby face. It was a beautiful for a ride. The tour was very interesting but the problem was that the people seated on the right side of the boat were able to see most of the alligators and other wildlife and the left side just tried to catch a glimpse. Unfortunately for us we were on the left side!!!!!    After the air boat ride we went to see their alligator show which was very quick maybe lasting 15 minutes and then you could have your picture taken with a baby alligator which had it's mouth taped shut.  It seemed everyone at the place was asking for tips as they said they were not paid and only lived on tips which is hard to believe. They put on quit the push for those tips.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jan 2020","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.373401Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T02:30:10.683837Z","inner_id":515,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2233,"annotations":[{"id":517,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":58,"end":70,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"hMK4u70WHj","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-05T02:30:17.683421Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T02:30:17.683421Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":6.788,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"9621cdd0-04c9-44be-a11b-af3d65080d81","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2233,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"nelsonjk","user_hometown":"3 contributions","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Awesome place to visit","content":"Captain Ashley was amazing.

For tourists,  this place will live up to expectations","content":"I guess the biggest disappointment is that I've been in Florida for 6 years.  I go fishing all the time.  The sights,  wildlife and food are all a part of everyday life.  I was hoping for something to WOW me,  learn something new.  It's definitely geared towards those from out of state.  Being a big fan of the show,  I was hoping to see my favorite guys doing their work.  I did not.  That's the bigges draw to that place! Again,  disappointing.  They do have some of the best,  covered airboats around for the tours however,  definitely making that a stand out feature from other tours.  The guides do know what they are talking about.  The gift shop and mini restaurant do offer good products at reasonable prices.  The frog legs are delicious,  especially with the buffalo ranch sauce.  I love my gator and my frog legs and these guys did not disappoint.  Overall,  if you're visiting from out of state,  it's a place to visit,  maybe catch a glimpse of the TV show stars.  If you have lived in Florida for any length of time,  it's a place to just stop by and go fishing or launch your boat at.  Personally,  if you want to get up close and personal with wildlife and have a blast while going fishing,  I'd highly recommend adding Lake Okeechobee to your itinerary and take an airboat tour with Big O Airboat Tours or a fishing guide trip with any of the captains out of Clewiston for some mega bass fishing.  Not taking away from Everglades Holiday Park,  because of you like that,  you'll love this as well.

If you didn’t know this already Paul Bedard is the only cast member that actually works there. I think one of the part time assistants to Paul, Chris, also works at the park but as far as stars of the show there is only Paul. The advertisement is a little misleading because you think you’ll meet the whole gang, not. If you want to see Paul you need to call ahead and find out what days he is there. Our airboat ride was underwhelming, we blame the weather not the Captain. The parking lot is flooded and they have a lot of construction so don’t expect to see some grandiose park, it looks like it’s in shambles. Then came the main attraction, Paul from the GatorBoys. Paul was personable, funny, goofy, and surprisingly nice. If I was rating just Paul I would have given this 5 stars but I had to consider the entire experience. Paul’s show wasn’t just geared to the kiddos, there was entertainment value for the adults too. Adult beverages are available for purchase. Still think the area for the gators appeared too small but it was comforting to hear Paul considers them part of his family. We loved his walk the dog trick. At the end of the show we got a picture of the whole family with Paul.,We enjoyed our visit and would definitely go back.Any word on when the GatorBoys will be back on the air?","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Nov 2020 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.373401Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T15:15:16.513628Z","inner_id":526,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2244,"annotations":[{"id":528,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":115,"end":127,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"C4bYsUfaB4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":253,"end":295,"text":"explained the history behind the waterways","labels":["educational"]},"id":"HWnKdPV1P2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":196,"end":242,"text":"looking at - alligators, birds, flora, iguanas","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"XYOctgDDTk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":335,"end":356,"text":"a show by a Gator Boy","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"O5CS0Wo-D8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":361,"end":485,"text":"explained the philosophy behind the conservation and rescue of alligators as well as the life cycle and habits of alligators","labels":["educational"]},"id":"SU3UQmO3hj","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":557,"end":572,"text":"Gator Boys show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"wSj5Y_Als_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":632,"end":688,"text":"a donation to help fund their work with Florida's gators","labels":["bequest"]},"id":"RS4AwYqIbK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":749,"end":775,"text":"a DVD of Gator Boys' shows","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"j36osCFB7P","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-05T15:17:44.194600Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T15:17:44.194600Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-05T15:15:58.640435Z","lead_time":147.467,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"d065a55f-a3cb-4088-b909-292262dbf0eb","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2244,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Kesteven","user_hometown":"Sydney, Australia","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Gator Boys and conservation","content":"Took this tour from my hotel in Fort Lauderdale - picked up and dropped back so it was super convenient.

Back at the Park itself we were given a show by a Gator Boy who explained the philosophy behind the conservation and rescue of alligators as well as the life cycle and habits of alligators. There's a small souvenir shop and you can get food and drink too. The Gator Boys show is done by volunteers so if you go make sure you give them a donation to help fund their work with Florida's gators.

But we decided to come, based on the tripadvisor reviews of the \"wonderful\" and \"thrilling\" and \"awesome\" airboat rides. I should have trusted my instincts. The place is filthy, and the area around the restrooms, \"cafe\" and alligator pit stinks to high heaven. If you are looking for a thrill ride thru the Everglades on a real airboat, you won't get it here. What you will get is a very large, covered boat that crams in 25 people; most of whom are stuck in the middle of the boat and can't see much of anything. I was lucky to get a side seat, but the rest of my party were in the middle. The front of the boat is enclosed by a filthy, barely transparent windshield. We had two very short spurts of \"racing through the swamps\" which was fun, but extremely brief. Most of the hour was spent creeping through the glades \"searching\" for gators. We saw 3.  They were in the exact place our captain said they would be before we got there...like they were planted there. We saw some beautiful birds, again, exactly where Capt Don said they would be.  I guess if you have small children, this might be a thrill for them. Our boat had only adults, and by the looks on everyone's faces they were as bored as we were.   Do some research.  Find a real airboat experience.

Booked the Everglades Holiday Park tour with transport to MIA through the ship. We were met at the port by a representative who stored our luggage and directed us to the air conditioned bus used to transport us to Everglades Holiday Park. The driver told us facts about Miami and the Everglades during our 30 minute ride to the park. Driver kept our personal items locked in the van and stayed on site with us during the excursion so that was helpful. Extremely hot day and not many shaded areas in the park to keep cool so that was difficult. Water (and food) was overly priced so bring your own if you can! Never been on an air boat so that was great fun and the captain was very knowledgeable about the Everglades and definately kept us entertained! Saw several alligators, iguanas and other wildlife. My teen daughter was a bit disappointed that we didn't see more but we can't control mother nature! After the air boat ride we watched a presentation featuring Animal Planet's \"Gator Boys\". Not sure what I was expecting to see but the show was lackluster - possibly due to the extreme heat that day - the 'gator wasn't co-operating! Did learn quite a bit from the Gator Boys and he included a lot of humor in his \"act\". Shortly after that, we were taken to MIA. I would probably give this tour a second chance and go again but it would be in weather that wasn't so hot. I will say, on a good note, there were no mosquitos at the time.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Aug 2018 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.387411Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T15:59:11.648706Z","inner_id":538,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2256,"annotations":[{"id":540,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":31,"end":43,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"TNQnOfxjET","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":56,"end":66,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"PIV8t1-J1g","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":174,"end":193,"text":"saw our first gator","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"sXNpAbpt61","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":221,"end":236,"text":"Everglades tour","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"qWcuptGqHM","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":241,"end":264,"text":"saw several more gators","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"03TFkuy5lk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":279,"end":397,"text":"informed about the different birds we were seeing, the various vegetation growing there, and the gators we were seeing","labels":["educational"]},"id":"79qh6M3EFy","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":485,"end":495,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"qgnbdVJxkR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-05T16:05:23.946504Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:05:23.946504Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-05T16:04:48.129463Z","lead_time":54.608,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"45917fdd-1f44-46d3-89da-9000730a4091","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2256,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Rick D","user_hometown":"Suffolk, VA","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great gator gazing!","content":"4 of us went over to go on the airboat ride and see the gator show.

We got to hold Oreo the alligator, Luna the albino alligator (my favorite), a snake and got to pet a skunk and Floyd the pig! I could have spent all day with these animals! The pictures they take and include are so fun to show to friends and family. Next we did the airboat ride. I knew there was a chance we may not see any gators but we got to see 6!!!! 1 kept circling the boat and another popped up right next to me!

We got up early, made the trek down south, and arrived to a mass of children, foreigners, and individuals more concerned with bug spray than gators. We were corralled into a air boat like cattle and paraded through a 20 minute loop in which we saw more air boats than wild life. We were lucky enough to see one tiny gator on our return trip to the dock, otherwise an entire waste of time and money. Following my disgust of this experience, we immediately Google searched for another location. We were fortunate enough to discover Everglades Holiday Park. We bought tickets on the smart phone en route, arrived to a dock house with a community feel, and were welcomed warmly by all staff we encountered. We purchased two beers and two gator koozies (for much cheaper than expected) and waited 10 minutes for our air boat ride to start. When our boat was called, we went down and met Captain Cody. This man was a fourth generation Floridian and had been a boat captain since he was 18, including years with the Coast Guard. This guy looked the part of an Everglade expert and it was obvious we were going to learn a lot, as if he was a rough leather bound book with the most elegant text to ever grace your eyes. Before fully shoving off from the dock, he educated us on the birds drying their wings on the buoys and used his eagle eyes to spot a massive gator in the distance beyond our air boat access. Already infinitely better than Gator Park. Throughout our entire trip, we saw at least six gators, an iguana, a beautiful hawk, vultures, and colorful fish. It helps when your tour is an hour long like it was here, compared to the measly 20 minutes at the previous park...Now I want to single out Captain Cody for a couple different reasons. This guy was the bomb. He was comical, knowledgeable, and humble, touching on all the essential characteristics of a tour guide. Beyond the obviously impressive wildlife of the Everglades, there is an incredible history to the area. Captain Cody was on top of all of the topics without missing a beat. We learned how the Everglades and canals came to be what they are today, how the Seminole Native Americans used to land to survive, incredible facts about the plant life in the area, and how human influence has introduced multiple species of plants (thanks to some genius scientist!) and animals (don't release your snakes into the wild!) into this fragile estate.Overall, this can certainly fall under the area of \"another Everglades air boat tour\" however thanks to Captain Cody it was certainly an event we will both remember for the rest of our lives. We can't wait for round two with the Captain!","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Aug 2018 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.387411Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:50:37.200443Z","inner_id":546,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2264,"annotations":[{"id":548,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":95,"end":123,"text":"raw beauty of the everglades","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"5dRsaN5d1e","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-05T16:51:22.929581Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T16:51:22.929581Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":45.441,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"993c807d-ca25-454e-b465-f841edb91967","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2264,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Jean K","user_hometown":"San Diego, CA","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Kind of weird","content":"I am not really sure how I feel about this place.

Ticket showed \"Everglades Holiday Park Airboat Tour Ticket.  Bridges Everglades, LLC\". The place was fairly busy.During our wait we grabbed lunch from their grill. The grill girl was quite rude. She didn't want to cook certain items as \"it would take too long\". Low quality products as the fried shrimp were frozen prebreaded, boxed shrimp. (this was one of those \"too long to cook\" items). Hot dogs, hamburgers, & fries were marginal. Did not get the gator bites. And watch for the black birds who will snatch your food from you in seconds!We were given Capt. Dan for our boat tour. (Ticket operator said all tours were basically the same). These are not open boats with the big fan, but roofed boats with open sides,. The captain sits on the back up high (with the fans), while the passengers sit at water level (so not the elevated view you'd expect).Capt Dan was a longtime capt there as he gave us an exhaustive history of himself and a few (questionable) near death experiences he said he had there. Nice guy, but  the boat never got over 10 miles per hour and rarely did it go any length. Tour took us geographically out of sight of, but not very far from the docks. 90% of the time we drifted looking at one or two alligators. (I've seen more and larger on a golf course)! Capt Dan seemed to think he was a bird whisperer and took us on what seemed to be his routine stops. He never, never stopped talking to us, but also talking to the birds. He'd find one or two birds here and there and say, that's Girtrude, or some other name as if he had some special connection. We were to be impressed I guess about that, as well as that he said these birds follow him where ever he goes. We saw 3 varieties of birds (mainly black birds) & some fish below lilly pads. My guess is that the black birds follow him b\/c the boat barely goes anywhere from A to B to C to D, so its quite easy for the birds to follow (and they know they'll get fed). Again no high speeds, no thrilling, white knuckle zoom through Everglades you'd expect, and very little travel distance. Most of the time the engine is off (likely to not burn much fuel) and the boat is working itself in somewhat a circle between mangrove seperations and the eventual return dock.My 6 and 9 year olds (and myself) were bored from the start and their grumbling about the sluggishness, heat (from sitting under a metal roof with little movement),  and low energy of the tour only made it more painful to endure. With no choice, we \"rode it out\", got back to land and wished we'd never wasted out time, only then to get stuck in bumper to bumper rush hour traffic through the outskirts of Miami or Ft. Lauderdale heading dowd toward the Keys!Never again. Once bitten.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Apr 2016 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.389279Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T18:43:40.817067Z","inner_id":575,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2293,"annotations":[{"id":577,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-28T18:43:48.472515Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T18:43:48.472515Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.361,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"4fbae52c-2130-4d57-a17d-c2a87b339b8c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2293,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Dawgslm","user_hometown":"Atlanta","rating":"1.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"This is a SCAM!

Had a good time out at this park and if you want to stay and fish you can do that as well so you don’t have to be in a hurry just hang out and put Aline in the water.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jul 2019 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.389279Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T16:36:16.478973Z","inner_id":599,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2317,"annotations":[{"id":601,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":4,"end":16,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"5Gs8rIvHfO","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":122,"end":131,"text":"boat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"uo4pDqmFDl","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":137,"end":141,"text":"show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"T-48rxjtTV","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-29T16:37:09.625662Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T16:37:09.625662Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-29T16:37:04.898629Z","lead_time":52.928,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"1536db8c-bb15-4563-9717-b6504b5f103e","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2317,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Leidy G","user_hometown":"Miami, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Amazing Time!","content":"The airboat ride was one of the most amazing thing I have done, the experience was insane not to mention they have 1 hour boat ride. the show was awesome and the gator boys being there honestly made the difference!

Our guide was a pro with the boat and showed us a ton of wild life.  We were really lucky to see 4 gators, a mating pair and then 2 solo gators.   They knew where they were, and they communicated to other captains to try and see more.   She was funny, she joked and made us laugh, it was a great ride.   The but......This place has the potential to turn into a frustration for people on a timeline, or for people that don't like to wait.   No where on their website does it explain to people (probably for a reason) that any bus tour that shows up will get on boats immediately, no matter how long anyone else has been waiting.  We were there at 8:45am to make sure we had a number 1 ticket, and we thought we were good to go - then 5 mega buses show up.  We were then informed that they take priority and that we were more then welcome to wait at the tables, or stand in line behind them. Thankfully the boats filled up fast, but we we still waited an hour before we even got on to a boat.   The boats are large, they hold close to 20 people sometimes, though they really try not to stick people in the middle where you cant really see anything.  I felt really bad for the people dead center with 2 people on either side - you can't really see, you can't take pictures - it's a horrible place to sit if you want to see any of that.  They should have not made the boats that big.  And don't think it's over either - the bus people get priority during the gator shows as well.  We were tired of waiting, so we left without seeing the show.  It's a bit smaller then we thought it would be since they are the \"Gator Boys\" but all in all, it was a really fun experience.  We will do it again with our kids, but this time we will know that we will be in for a wait and not get so frustrated.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/07\/c6\/22\/9b\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/07\/c6\/22\/9e\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/07\/c6\/22\/a2\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/07\/c6\/22\/a4\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/07\/c6\/22\/a9\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/07\/c6\/22\/ad\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Apr 2015 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.389279Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T19:34:55.696494Z","inner_id":603,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2321,"annotations":[{"id":605,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":179,"end":201,"text":"gators, other wildlife","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"njn4fGAh-h","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":256,"end":321,"text":"pick up baby alligators out of the swamp anymore to show the kids","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"5QuUKzxI7I","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-29T19:35:31.752691Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T19:35:31.752691Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-29T19:35:16.095307Z","lead_time":35.832,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"a1ac4d2f-6f12-43b1-86df-055c0cbc7e58","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2321,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"BrinsonD","user_hometown":"Milton, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Still a great tour after 30 years","content":"Took my teenage boys here where I used to go \"swamping\" when I was in grade school.

This was a post cruise stop.  The air boats have metal bench seating and not stadium style, so those sitting in the middle have an obstructed view.   We have been on another air boat tour in Florida, see my review. At the other location we observed many alligators in the wild and each time the air boat got to close (with engine running) the alligators would submerge and then come back up.  At Holiday Park there was one aligator in the wild which whispers amung the other visitors, is it real or fake, I find it hard to beleave a aligtor would allow boat after boat to invade it's space.  This 1 aligator didn't submirge, take off, only floated around in a small area, all the time the air boat engine was roaring and  switching from left side viewing to right side viewing, there was also another air boat in front of ours at the same spot and 2 more lined up behind us.  The Gater Boys show was OK.  $5 to take a picture holding the baby aligator with your own camera.  I will NOT return to this location but would definatly return to the other one I visited.  Bathroom facilities require a line up if it's busy and when the cruise ships are returning it is busy.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/03\/8b\/1c\/f1\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/03\/8b\/1d\/06\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/03\/8b\/1d\/17\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/03\/8b\/1d\/25\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/03\/8b\/1d\/38\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Feb 2013 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.389279Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T19:48:34.087863Z","inner_id":605,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2323,"annotations":[{"id":607,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":169,"end":209,"text":"saw many iquanas, birds and an alligator","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"QJ_FCiuK9s","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":132,"end":148,"text":"see the wildlife","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"B7RoTk-Bx6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":153,"end":164,"text":"take photos","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"m5rJ6nkoT_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":214,"end":268,"text":"explained the intent, use and health of the Everglades","labels":["educational"]},"id":"VVExSINnf7","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":381,"end":398,"text":"a flower necklace","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"ZvE4puZ2h0","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":447,"end":480,"text":"Gator Boys Alligator presentation","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"nh5En-xeEJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-29T19:52:20.105353Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T19:52:20.105353Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-29T19:51:11.316395Z","lead_time":225.799,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"bffb5ada-a1b3-4ffb-8802-651c688a7ecc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2323,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Global53821","user_hometown":"2 contributions","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great way to spend some time getting to understand the Everglades","content":"Our airboat captain, Captain Charlie, was very engaging and informative.

I know and I am aware that this is the beauty of nature however I still think it's over priced if you get picked up. We've been asked by our driver (Rafael) yesterday on our way back to the hotel to add 15% gratuities that were forgotten to be charged by the Manager and we did not give it to him of course... A gratuity is not a must and if it was, it should have been added to the bill that we paid. How can you forget that? It's clearly up to the customers to tip we feel like it but there is not such things of charging 15% of the big to get gratuities. Imagine how much would have been that trip? It's sad to see that tourists are seen as wallets when traveling and this way it was disgustingly done...The \"Show\" on that day wasn't a proper show... The pipe did brake so there was no water for the aligators and all of us were expecting a proper show which would 'WOW' us but this did not happen unfortunately.The staff and the driver (Rafael) is very friendly except 1 or 2 girls wearing brown shorts and an orange jacket... They kinda scream and expedite people when the tour is over, seems like clearly just interested in the money?... Quite sad!! I wonder where does the 10 and 15$ goes to whenever we take a picture with a snake or a baby alligator?? I sincerely hope this money goes to their food and veterinary fees!!The information provided were very good and informative so thank you for that!I was expecting with my dear fellow colleagues to have a different experience and see quite a few aligators in the nature but this is out of anyone's hands I believe however it would have been a different experience if we were pushed to feel that money plays a big role in this tourist adventure...

We selected this company as it was closest to us, economical and did not need reservations. The airboat ride was wonderful. They are renovating the spot, as they should, but the the renovation was very loud. So while we waited for about 20 minutes we were unable to talk. it was interesting to watch though.The ride was about an hour and Jimbo, our captain, was great. We saw osprey, an iguana, about 5 alligators, cranes, tons of birds and learned about the Everglades. Jimbo circled each animal so both sides could see it and then moved on to provide the least amount of trauma to the animal. I appreciate that. The boat was covered and it rained a bit and we were dry. Birds kept landing on the top. We were out of the sun and the airboat was quieter - as some others on the boat mentioned this was different than other rides. Although we couldn’t look forward as a result, we missed nothing. The alligators were CLOSE, AKA within 1 foot of the boat.There were 14 people on the boat so we could slide from side to side to see things. He mentioned that sometimes there are 26 on the boat. We then went to see the show. It was a bit different with only 14 in the audience that can hold up to 250, but it was interesting nonetheless. A little cheesy at points, but he was personable and informative.With the tips for the airboat ride and the show, both mentioning this was their only source of income, the experience was pricier than anticipated.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/86\/0c\/2b\/construction-site-while.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/86\/0c\/29\/how-close-the-alligators.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/86\/0c\/25\/view-of-one-of-the-canals.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Jan 2021","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.389279Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T19:59:58.951925Z","inner_id":615,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2333,"annotations":[{"id":617,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":107,"end":119,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"DJtJMPnA42","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":187,"end":197,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"lmKk9UHHkR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-30T20:00:18.879588Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T20:00:18.879588Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-30T20:00:13.274587Z","lead_time":16.98,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"8827cb18-45c0-49b3-8ac2-ecf4613b5529","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2333,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"jlkimps","user_hometown":"Whitewater, WI","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"A must","content":"Booked an adventure  at everglades holiday park on June 16th, 2018.

The gentleman preforming was very personable and good at what he does. You could tell he genuinely cares about his alligators. The little enclosure made me a little sad, seemed kind of dingy and old and small. These gators were HUGE. Our tour included two free pictures, but they had an albino gator that you could hold with another baby gator for another $20. Gulp. But I did it and the kids were happy. Then of course you can get magnets or key chains ... Your free pictures can really add up. But when are they ever going to get to hold another albino alligator again?!

If you want to see alligators most likely you will because I learned they feed the gators off the boats so when they hear it coming they think food and come out. The gator show after the boat ride was just as lame a couple stupid stunts with the gator and it was over.

We went here after we couldn’t get on at Big Swamp. It was busy, but there were plenty of boats in operation and we didn’t have to wait very long. Plus, it is a bit less expensive than other local operators. The boats are covered, which offers protection from the sun but on the other hand does detract from the airboat “wind in the hair” experience. Also, it was crowded on the circuit, with one boat after another, so we didn’t get the feeling is solitude that I’ve experienced on other airboat rides. It would be good if they provided ear defenders, as the boat engines are rather noisy. The guide, captain mike, was knowledgeable and enthusiastic, providing a good commentary and answering any questions. We did see a few gators and birds, which was fun, and the short gator wrestling show afterwards was quite entertaining. This was good, but there are other tours that offer a better experience.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.389279Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T21:58:36.630525Z","inner_id":639,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2357,"annotations":[{"id":641,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":35,"end":47,"text":"Airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"R2lnVMTvr4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":155,"end":177,"text":"saw several Alligators","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"OWL-Bz5AxN","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":203,"end":232,"text":"check out the various animals","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"C-UPiKwlaf","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-30T21:59:06.992306Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T21:59:06.992306Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-30T21:58:57.967154Z","lead_time":30.153,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"bc67024a-dc23-4b67-8a68-36a8ac70ff5a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2357,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"wolfhill","user_hometown":"Harrow","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"A must see if you go to Florida","content":"We spent a few hours there with an Airboat ride as the main attraction.

The simple WILD of the Everglades is new and different.  The Air Boat ride, with a knowledgeable guide makes for an interesting and fun 30 minutes. If you get Capt. Chuck, you'll be well informed, as well as entertained. All three times we've been there, a 'gator' has come right up to the boat, nose to hull.  Great photo op.  The rest of the park has 2 or 3 short informative 'shows' that provide a lot of information about the native animals that have been rescued, and now reside in the park.  You even get to hold baby alligators.  One of the things I love about this park is that the staff truly care about the animals.  This isn't a 'job' to them, it's an opportunity to care for these creatures; everything from boa's to panthers to owls, to \"Cannibal\" the daddy-gator, that calls this park home.  If you want to see the glades, hear the stories, and see the animals up close, this is the place.  There's a snack shack with drinks and hot or cold snacks, including gator bites;  a well stocked gift store, and a very helpful and friendly staff.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Oct 2015 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.389279Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T02:23:28.113401Z","inner_id":641,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2359,"annotations":[{"id":643,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":98,"end":111,"text":"air boat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"XpqoMQK4VG","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":212,"end":226,"text":"alligator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"rgsceXPN4j","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":341,"end":389,"text":"take their pictures sitting on a large alligator","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"3KwAEDwfG7","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-01T02:24:39.697256Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T02:24:39.697256Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-01T02:24:26.991250Z","lead_time":71.352,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"b298fae0-4cf9-43f8-92c9-1a8f2bb2de67","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2359,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"kpatters","user_hometown":"Victoria, Canada","rating":"3.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Short Boat Ride & Weird Alligator Show","content":"We came here as part of our Princess Cruise morning excursion before heading to the airport.

Also a restaurant would be recommended.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jul 2013 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.389279Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T02:34:06.295703Z","inner_id":649,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2367,"annotations":[{"id":651,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":68,"end":111,"text":"saw several alligators, birds and wild life","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"8tmrioLN1A","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-01T02:34:13.498186Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T02:34:13.498186Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":6.908,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"bb293789-6e97-4fc3-91fb-a7803c577d20","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2367,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Footprints295740","user_hometown":"3 contributions","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Everglades tour","content":"Swampy J was great!

However, it's one of the better deals around as the hour-long airboat ride also comes with a short 15 minute show and 2 free printed photos with a baby alligator. The airboat ride is fun. This is one of the only places I've seen where the airboats are actually covered, providing some shade on those super sunny days. The boats seat up to around 20 people though. So, they could get crowded and you may not get a great seat on the side for prime gator viewing.On our trip, we saw one gator in the first 40 minutes and then another 8 in the remaining 20 minutes. Our captain, Rocky, was personable enough though he heavily favored the left side of the boat where he sat, and folks on the right side got very little opportunity to get up close and personal with the gators. In addition to alligators, we also saw ospreys, iguanas, an armadillo, egrets, and other birds.The show was okay - definitely not the highlight of the visit, but a reasonably entertaining talk where you learn more about alligators and their rescue program.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/60\/ac\/8d\/pxl-20201129-195044114.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/60\/ac\/8c\/pxl-20201129-204352988.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/60\/ac\/8b\/pxl-20201129-205513268.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/60\/ac\/8a\/pxl-20201129-205515944.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/60\/ac\/89\/pxl-20201129-205631207.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/60\/ac\/88\/pxl-20201129-210602605.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/60\/ac\/87\/pxl-20201129-210601660.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/60\/ac\/86\/pxl-20201129-211801030.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Nov 2020 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.389279Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T02:56:55.380813Z","inner_id":652,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2370,"annotations":[{"id":654,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":124,"end":133,"text":"boat trip","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"tr9Ks6T0m9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":151,"end":173,"text":"baby alligator to hold","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"re4sZC7T4C","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-01T03:11:01.719315Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T03:11:01.719315Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-01T03:10:52.741821Z","lead_time":846.008,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"1b3c4871-a03c-446b-ae34-a5aa9b9512ca","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2370,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Maria H","user_hometown":"2 contributions","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Alligators","content":"Captain Kathy was a great guide!

Overall, it was a mildly entertaining way to spend 1-2 hours.  You wouldn't want to stay there longer.  In a nutshell, you buy a ticket for an airboat ride through the Everglades.  You then wait for them to call your ticket number (we waited for 15-20 minutes).  You get on a boat with about 15-20 people.  Together, you spend an hour seeing alligators swimming alongside you, native birds, and learn about the local foliage.  Interesting stuff, and certainly worth an hour's ride.Then, and only after the boat ride, can you see the alligator show.  This wasn't really what I expected in that it's not much of a show.  You line up down a long area and stand to watch a guy get in a fenced off area with a dozen alligators.  He chooses one of them, hold the alligator's mouth open, then closed, then open, then closed, then puts his head against the teeth... all while cracking jokes and saying how dangerous this is (which I believe).  The entire \"show\" lasts about 10 minutes (maybe less).  I kept thinking it was the pre-show or something, until we were filed out when it was over.Overall, it's a little park, with a small gift shop, a place to line up for your airboat ride and a little (as in not long) alligator show.  However, it was an interesting experience for a change of pace from the beach.  If you have a day where you don't know what else to do, it's worth an hour or two of your time.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Mar 2016 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.389279Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T16:30:49.956826Z","inner_id":677,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2395,"annotations":[{"id":679,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":23,"end":44,"text":"everglades boat tours","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"ZldltmcPgV","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":83,"end":95,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"BpGwMs8t8v","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":172,"end":200,"text":"got a show with an alligator","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"KM8QUTaZ7j","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":205,"end":233,"text":"got to hold a baby alligator","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"wm1r8xaAUt","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-01T16:31:13.864137Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T16:31:13.864137Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-01T16:31:00.779238Z","lead_time":23.578,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"6e34f885-3e1d-4a81-8d5c-6a94b6189675","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2395,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Saundra M","user_hometown":"1 contribution","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great tour at a great price","content":"When compared to other everglades boat tours this one is best by far, get a 60 min airboat ride cheaper then others that was only 30 min, the people were nice and after we got a show with an alligator and got to hold a baby alligator.

I have to admit, I have never seen there television show, but you could tell by the way he spoke that he truly cared about alligators and their wellbeing.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Apr 2017 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.389279Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T18:37:14.725415Z","inner_id":695,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2413,"annotations":[{"id":697,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":88,"end":106,"text":"see the gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"JVCS0AM-x0","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":227,"end":236,"text":"boat tour","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"ddRxtN5iz9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":436,"end":445,"text":"boat tour","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"Uf3Wqm4d7V","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":477,"end":487,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"Avvjq3adO3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-01T18:38:12.139400Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T18:38:12.139400Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-01T18:37:50.736818Z","lead_time":57.038,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"6ada6fac-5ada-4fcb-97e6-6e94adebe65b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2413,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Real C","user_hometown":"Boucherville, Canada","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Nice Adventure","content":"Nice place to pass a 2h (or more) in a beautiful environment.We went there specially to see the gator show.

We had a family group of 12, 6 were children. They said only 10 on a boat unless we paid 100$ more for “private”. Still not 100% sure why social distancing of 10 is out the window with an extra $100 but after some compromise and my brother getting upset my husband and I just defused the situation by separating our family on different boats. Our boat captain Jeremy turned what started rough into an amazing experience. We saw 6 gators and we were extremely close to them. Our 9year old is obsessed so this was a dream for her! Jeremy was comical and informative! The gator show is definitely not eventful but more informative and calm. Which was perfect for our gator lover. Paul took interest in our daughters love for gators and visited with her and us after the show. Even showed her a personal video of them on his phone. After she held the baby gator and the lady(not sure of name but will show partial picture) was informative and even allowed us to admire and pet the gator for a few mins after allowing my daughter to see every detail of the little guy. What started our iffy turned into an amazing experience due to those three staff members.

Some very young man who claims to be an alligator wrestler tried to make some really dumb jokes and he opened the alligator's mouth, put his face on it while open and pretty much just talked about alligators. It wasn't all that informative and it was NOT entertaining. The BEST part of this was when we got to hold a baby alligator and have our picture taken. That lasted all of 30 seconds. The entire time we were there, the operators and show people were asking for tips. We purchased tickets online. When we arrived, the cashier tried to up sell us into an animal encounter with a skunk, pig, snake, tortise and something else. Online it was something like $69. She said that they had deeply cut the rate and it was $20, but one of us had to be with our daughter - well of course we do. We had to PAY FOR THAT! Really?

doesn't work and they were reluctant to help at all!the area of the park is clean and attractive. the other thing that I should mention is that the airboats of this park are covered which can be good to protect you from the sun and also the the engine noise... but at the other two parks the airboats are not covered which may be interesting in the way that you can have a broader view of the scenes

Thru a scheduling\/communication snafu we were picked up nearly 1 1\/2 hrs late.    Our tour incl a 60 min airboat tour with narration.  Very loud engines, narration was cheesy at best but we did see 3 -  6 ft alligators and a baby (18 in long).  The airboat pilot knew just where to look.  Temps about 88 deg with Florida humidity, water depth was 2-3 ft mostly.  After the airboat ride we were shuttled to the alligator show where a former “Gator Boy” TV star played with a coupla gators, cracked jokes and then said, “shows over, don’t forget to contribute”.   Stood in line longer than the show lasted....Not much shade sitting in the bleachers and glad to go.  Photo ops with Burmese python, albino gator and a “you-can-hold-the 2 ft croc” photo op.     No sooner had we ordered our food (gator bites (8 pcs, dice sized) and fries ($11.95) we were told by the shuttle driver that we had to leave NOW......    That obviously doesn’t bode well, a coupla of us ate our lunch on the 30 min drive to the BW Airport hotel.    Very bad organization, remember they were 1 1\/2 hrs late picking us up at the ship ??  So now we have to leave because they’ve got other parties to pick up ????    Hot, humid day, ok boat ride, boring alligator show, overpriced theme park food, not allowed time to eat said lunch.....I wasn’t  over-wowed by the experience.        If you’re interested in seeing alligators in their natural habitat but don’t expect anything beyond theme-park mentality, this might be your must see.   After an hour and a half delay, no priority “lunch is on us” or partial refund offers, we were just left amongst the masses.

They claim be all about saving the native species but then they treat the gators in a tiny area and create extreme stress for them.  They say the gators are relaxing but, that isn’t so.

I have always wanted to ride in one, since I have seen them in movies and TV they look so cool.....Also learned that they have little John Boats for rent at the location, and next time I am in the area I want to check those out...maybe do a little fishing in the everglades.  I saw fishing poles, and think they rent those out as well....For the price of the boat tour we got to see the Gator Boys show. That was really cool!  Prob the funniest part was before the guy sticks his head in the gators mouth he said \"this is where a degree in Criminal Justice got him\"!  It was a good little show, and it seems like they have fun. Also they help rehome the gators caught by trappers- who would normally kill them for their skins etc, and for a few bucks donation to their fund you can get your picture taken with the little gator.This was also easy to find, and not far from the Main rd, so was a great way to see the Everglades!","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/03\/df\/89\/43\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/03\/df\/89\/49\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/03\/df\/89\/52\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/03\/df\/89\/59\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/03\/df\/89\/5e\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/03\/df\/89\/62\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Apr 2013 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.405894Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T02:37:28.240888Z","inner_id":788,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2506,"annotations":[{"id":794,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":23,"end":32,"text":"boat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"ErGh5hk3Wc","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":55,"end":71,"text":"Saw three gators","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"sNcdD7Q3i6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":76,"end":136,"text":"learned a lot about the wildlife and flora of the Everglades","labels":["educational"]},"id":"MU68gtf3Lf","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-02T02:37:37.757922Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T02:37:37.757922Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-02T02:37:36.568744Z","lead_time":9.3,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"2035a959-6591-4e7f-9a87-3d1bbb282720","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2506,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Krista W","user_hometown":"2 contributions","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Airboat tour and Gator watching in wild!","content":"We loved our visit and boat ride with captain Armando!

The boat held more than 20 people, and we were crammed in like sardines. Seriously, we were in the 2nd row, and I could not sit straight because of knee room (I'm 5-9). The front windshield was so dirty and scratched that it gave zero visibility. The guide was very knowledgeable, and he was diligent in trying to find us gators. We saw 2--one hiding under a tree where the water was calm, and another swimming in the open. We thought that we'd get to drive fast--we did, but only for about  2 minutes of the 45 minute tour. The gator show at the end was fine. We did appreciate that the park is a sanctuary for gators that would otherwise be destroyed.Best tips: go when the wind and water are calm.

The airboat ride was a perfect way to pass time mid-day. Although it was very sunny out, because the boat has a covered roof and the day was breezy, we were pretty comfortable.  Captain Eric is a great host, very knowledgeable about local wildlife, from native to invasive species (and fish to fowl). We were able to see several alligators and for the first time a female eating! I've been to several of the alligator theme parks in South Florida but this was honestly the best. The hour just flew by and I really appreciated how our Captain was so attentive and patient with everyone's questions. We were in a mixed group of different age ranges\/nationalities, and our Captain was just as interested in talking to the adults as the kids. I'm especially proud to be a Floridian when I see tourists having a good experience and being treated well-after all, our state relies heavily on the presence and generosity of tourism!All in all, it was time well spent, and the free photo at the end a nice touch. I'd like to add the the other staff at the park are really patient and customer service oriented,  which was impressive considering there were literally hundreds of people there at the park coming from tour buses. We arrived as the tour buses were leaving, but it was still organized considering the volume.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.405894Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T02:41:30.276884Z","inner_id":794,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2512,"annotations":[{"id":800,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":452,"end":464,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"2Amm5FeLZ9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":682,"end":707,"text":"see something else, birds","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"DsokpXGoeZ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-02T02:42:21.238304Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T02:42:21.238304Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-02T02:42:06.525887Z","lead_time":50.732,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"6b8fad08-0382-4cba-ae6e-b5f780e44b34","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2512,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"linareva","user_hometown":"Ingleside, IL","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"nice, but too short","content":"We took this tour as part of our disembarkation from a Princess CruiseOur bus guide was very knowledgeable about the area, she did some singing, drumming.

Not sure this met the criteria but it was okay.   We got to this off the Turnpike (about 10 miles).  This place is on a canal and has airboat rides up until 4:20 PM in Dec. Probably based on when sunset happens.  Ride was approximately 1 hour.  Cost was $23.50 per adult.  Some folks had coupons but not sure where they got them.  Boats are covered and have a plexigalss front so pictures are only from sides.  Boat drivers are your guides and do attempt to turn boats so both sides can take any pictures they want. I would say in total we road less than 2 miles on the canals. I have included pictures that show what you will mostly see - grasses and a lily pad type flower plant growing in the water.  The rides do speed up at times but don't think you will be ripping along. The driver turns the boat from side to side to make it seem fun. Boat engines are from Cadillacs and these boats looked homemade, not what you think it will be.  We saw several gators, 4-7 species of birds, iguanas, and various vegetation.  Guides were knowledgable on plants, etc.  Boats have about six rows of seats and ours had people in about 4 rows and were not crowded but seated by number in party with some parties taking 2 rows. Children on the boat seemed entertained.  They do take a group picture before you leave and try to sell it to you.  They have a take out  window that sells gator bites that we did not buy.  There appears to a camp ground on site but were not camping and I do not know details.  Other people did come up and put boats (more like what you expect if you watched Miami CSI) into the water from the ramp located beside the ramp your boat leaves from.  I think was an okay experience and I did not choose this but let others in my party choose.  They wanted a boat ride and they got it but stated it wasn't as fast as they thought it would be. Women's room had 3 stalls but only one flushed.  2 stalls had been used by people knowing that it didn't flush.  I think that tells you something. Prior to the ride they give you a \"Gator Show\".  It is a young man in a fenced area with bout 8 alligators.  He uses only one and shows how to open the mouth and talks about the line of sight a gator has and demonstrates how he uses this to handle the gator.  For $10 you can sit on a gator and get your picture made by your friends and for $5 you can hold a baby gator.  I was not impressed.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/02\/3c\/80\/16\/this-is-the-boat-you.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/02\/3c\/80\/18\/gator-show-pay-for-pic.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/02\/3c\/80\/1b\/feed-sold-so-you-can.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/02\/3c\/80\/1d\/gator-we-were-shown.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/02\/3c\/80\/1e\/last-ride-of-day-got.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/02\/3c\/81\/43\/grass-and-plants-see.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/03\/35\/36\/63\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Dec 2011 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.405894Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T02:46:27.999125Z","inner_id":797,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2515,"annotations":[{"id":803,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-02T02:46:35.765475Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T02:46:35.765475Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.553,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"aa06d202-8b04-4d51-ab03-ea91b9824c8e","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2515,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Haybim","user_hometown":"Bridgetown, Saint Michael, Barbados","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Alligator tour and show","content":"Great day but transfer back to hotel took 2 hours......way too long as it only took 45 mins to get there!!!!!","img_urls":"","tour_time":"May 2017 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.405894Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T02:46:35.809239Z","inner_id":798,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2516,"annotations":[{"id":804,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":16,"text":"Road the airboat","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"ljEbo06yUA","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-02T02:46:46.732050Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T02:46:46.732050Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":10.728,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"24e0c456-eceb-457b-b052-2445be0e29ea","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2516,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Kate N","user_hometown":"1 contribution","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Swamp Thing!!","content":"Road the airboat with Swamp Thing!

check it out , It is by far the most well advertised park and so is the most well known and is the park that most ticket booths \/ ticket sellers seem to sell tours toFor that reason it is VERY busy with coach loads of people pulling up often ,we found it to be to busy for our liking ,the place isn't all that big , on top of that it seemed to be over priced for what I would call pretty poor attractions , the Airboats are some of the poorest I have seen , the seats are all on the same level , with a covered roof and seat 6 or more deep , meaning that only people on the outside stand any chance of seeing anything , The area that the boats went in seemed poor and not that large a area , lacking in wildlife The Alligator show again was very poor, in a very small area , I would much sooner see a wild  Alligator then a captive one , and just up the road at shark valley you can do just that for a fraction of the cost It seemed to me that this was the first \"park\" on the highway form both Miami or Fort Lauderdale and so was the most quickest and convenient park to ship paying guests to If you drive right past this park you past many other more little parks that also offer Airboat Rides , most on a REAL airboat and most don't have the big crowds , if you keep on driving 30 minutes past you will come to shark Valley national park , just $5 to enter you will see dozens of 5ft to 6ft Alligators (in the winter months) right within walking distance , you can take a tram tour for the same cost of a Airboat Ride and I can guarantee you will see much more REAL wildlife  my advise if you are driving is , drive on right past MUCH better to be found further past this park , REAL airboats , smaller ones not geared around fitting as many paying guests as they can onto a boat , if your going to pay to ride a Airboat at least ride a real one , drive to a smaller park that appreciates your custom more , keep on driving to Shark Valley and you will not be disappointed , it will then make you realize just how poor this park is","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jan 2015 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday

The fan boat through the Everglades was informative and the guide had information on plants, birds and fish native to the area. We saw 1 gator on the tour. Which was cool. The tour was an hour which was long enough.     The gator show was about 15 minutes or so. It was a bit boring in my opinion, I’ve seen more exciting ones in pass on previous trip to Florida.  Their is food available and a gift shop with half decent prices. We eat at a McDonald’s about 3 miles away.    One thing I found strange is theirs a public boat ramp right in the middle of the parking lot area and next to the line for the fan boat ride.

And unlike one negative reviewer who said they had to pay $60 for five people to watch the show is total BS. THE ALLIGATOR SHOW IS FREE! If you want to take a airboat tour then you must pay for that, of course. Since I was with my elderly mother who is terrified of water and my beloved Chihuahua, we skipped the airboat ride. With my Chihuahua safely inside her stroller we stood right next to the fence while Chris Gillette put on a fabulous show.  At the end he took a few questions and stated that donations are not required but welcomed. They did ask for a donation for getting your photo taken with a baby gator. I believe it was only a few dollars. Of course, my mother loved that and got a great photo with \"Sponge Bob\". He wasn't tiny but probably 3 feet long. I can't recall but I think Chris said he was 2 years old. Not sure. That was in 2013. Sponge Bob is probably now huge and not privy to selfies but he was that day.  The photo opportunity was well worth it. Sponge Bob was so sweet he even fell asleep. :-) The care and love for the alligators is truly apparent here. As a 20+ year vegan and diehard lover of animals. I am always watching for any sign of abuse or neglect when I am out and about. The people who have created this alligator rescue are amazing. The care and attention they provide the gators is what you'd expect in a 5-star hotel.  Rescues like this deserve all the donations they can get. They depend on donations to continue. It's not cheap to feed an alligator and they have many! Plus, vet care, equipment, transportation, etc. all costs money and lots of it. They bring in injured or sick gators rehabilitate them and release them back into the wild. Some are unable to be released for various reasons thus, have a life long home at the rescue, being treated like a king or queen. Alligators have a bad reputation and shouldn't. They're amazing creatures and if you've never been up close to one then you must. Alligators are living dinosaurs and deserve our help and attention just as any other animal. Donating to the Gator Boys Alligator Rescue is tax deductible. The more you give the more you can deduct. Always, say no to items made from alligator skins or body parts.  Save an alligator from being skinned alive for ugly handbags, boots, and belts or from being served in a restaurant. Keep them in the wild and keep rescues like this one alive and doing whatever they can to protect the beautiful and powerful alligator. Please donate and tell others. I recorded the show and posted it on Vimeo.

The trip was completely ruined by our tour boat Capt. Rick or Rich.  He did nothing but talk about himself and his experiences for an hour.  We came to Holiday Park to have a fun ride and learn about the Everglades.  Well, all we kept hearing about was Capt. Rick's 43 years in the Everglades and \"his back yard\" as he would say.  When the airboat was moving things were OK.  But once we stopped we knew we were about to hear from Capt. All About Me.  Unfortunately he likes to talk so we spent more time stopped then moving.  His constant rambling about himself became uncomfortable and disturbing.  He even when as far as to say the other Captains in company followed him and that he trained them all.  God I hope not. Based on other reviews I can see that this isn't true. If you get Capt. Rick\/Rich(?), go to the end of the line and wait for another boat.  He was awful and we will never go back or recommend this company to anyone. I was so disappointed that this guy ruined my families first experience on an airboat.    Other things you should know.  Due to the Gator Boys show this place is packed and the lines are long.  The gator show is 5 min tops, with limited educational value. The airboats have roofs so you miss out on half the experience of riding in an AIR boat,  you don't get to feel the air.  Bad Call Holiday Park.  Yes, you'll stay dry in a Thunderstorm but isn't experiencing the elements part of the adventure?   Finally, the Everglades Holiday Park operates in a canal region of the Everglades.  You don't feel like your in the everglades at all.  It's more like a boat ride in a marsh lands along any east coast river.  My suggestions is to try Sawgrass Recreation Park up the road about 10-15 minutes.  Open boats and educated guides who talk about the Everglades, not themselves. They also provide a show and even have numerous other critters to see and learn about.  Sorry about the bad review but I wouldn't recommend this place over the others in the area.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Mar 2013 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.422558Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T03:46:41.946240Z","inner_id":834,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2552,"annotations":[{"id":840,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-02T03:46:51.900086Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T03:46:51.900086Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":9.739,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"2a7ac676-db48-4243-9758-9f2b23161116","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2552,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"b_perigo","user_hometown":"Boswell, PA","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Captain Leo!","content":"We just got back from the park an hour ago.

The park is easy to find with GPS and close by Ft. Lauderdale. There's ample parking and the site is well run and organized. Adult admissions are $15 each, Children's tickets purchased on Groupon were $13.25 each,but buy them on the Holiday park website and they're only $11 per child. Our total cost for 2 adults and 2 children was $52! After purchasing tickets wait by the docks on benches under shaded sun ports for your number to be called. Have a friend take your family picture because the park guides take them and will be happy to sell you an 8 x 10\" for $10 after you exit the boat ride.We declined them since we took our own. Really with everyone bringing cameras and cameraphones this is a lame, anarchronistic moneymaking stunt. We were at the front of the line and were able to sit in the front row. Since it was raining the visibility out the plexiglass windshield was limited there was ample viewing out the sides. The driver constantly turns the boat so port and starboard passengers get good views. There are many photo ops. Just set your camera vibration control \"on.\"  Our guide, Rich, was very funny and a wealth of knowledge about the history and wildlife in the ecosystem. As an adult I found the tour educational and enjoyable. My grand kids loved it too. The older girl had already studied alligators in school so this field trip was a valuable field experience. The tour was one hour long. After about 40 minutes the similar views become tiresome. We did not see that much wildlife; two alligators, groups of vultures, an egret, and some grackles, starlings, and iridescent peahens that came to the boat to be fed popcorn.The driver guns the engines on three occasions and the boat flies on plane with the front off the water! The noise is deafening.  Bring ear plugs.This ride trumps one on a roller coaster. There was a two year old girl behind us who was so frightened she cried the entire ride. I would rate this attraction appropriate for ages 5 and up. At the end of the ride our driver Rich made his pitch for tips by announcing: \"We work for tips so if you enjoyed my tour any tips would be greatly appreciated.\" I thought this was a venal act and resented him shaming guests into giving gratuities. Yes, he did earn it but I don't need to be prodded to fork over the dollars. Gratuities are earned and people will respond if they desire to do so. Broward County or whoever runs the park should be responsible for seeing that their are adequately reimbursed. I know FL is a \"right to work state.\" Are these drivers not paid as stated? Shame on Broward County. We left the boat, declined the $10 photo, and lined up for the alligator show by the \"Gator Boys.\" Be forewarned...stand in front or wait for the next show or you will not get a place where your children can see the show. We were at the end of the line. You don't want to be here if you bring young children. When the crowd was admitted all the adults ran to grab all the positions along the fence. There is a 4 ft. high wall in the pit and then protective fencing above that. No tiered seating exists as in Seaworld Miami. Our grandchildren has no place to stand and view the show so I had to hold my 6 year old grandaughter on my shoulders which was temporary. The \"Gator Boys\" need to be trained in audience control. A simple \"Adults, please step back and permit the younger shorter children to stand in front so they can see the show.\" The adults there were selfish and no one volunteered to let the children move in front of them. There were over a dozen huge protected alligators inside that the kids could not see. We got frustrated and left early. Afterwards we ate the picnic lunch we brought. There are ample picnic tables under sunports for sitting and eating, as are outdoor clean bathrooms. Bring a picnic lunch, leave it in the car which you park below the decks, and eat an enjoyable meal. There are food and drinks available but you can save $$$$ bringing your own drinks and food. The park admissions are expensive enough without having to buy food for a family of six or more. Want to see more? Don't miss the Shark Valley trip. Many more alligators seen close up or from the observation tower. Take a bike tour or a tram ride tour.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/a0\/f6\/cc\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/a0\/f6\/d4\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/a0\/f6\/dd\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/a0\/f6\/e9\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/05\/a0\/f6\/f6\/everglades-holiday-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Mar 2014 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.422558Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T03:51:23.599486Z","inner_id":838,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2556,"annotations":[{"id":844,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":113,"end":128,"text":"see an aligator","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"C-F96eLyBW","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":146,"end":159,"text":"Aligator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"EtlpCk4kSG","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":170,"end":182,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"oCQMKZIgRK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-02T15:34:22.063432Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T15:34:22.063432Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-02T15:34:21.322810Z","lead_time":42178.251,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"2943a4c8-4849-4ba3-9894-1934ec7723cc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2556,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"roger r","user_hometown":"Santa Teresa, Costa Rica","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great Day trip","content":"Every time I have people coming in to visit I take them to Holiday Park.

We went inside to see if he could get on the next cruise and ride with our four year old again (just transferring tickets we already purchased). We were told NO.

It never fails to impress. There is something about seeing live gators in their natural habitat that makes people's jaws drop. Of course it is humid, of course it is usually hot, of course it is usually a sunny day when you want to go. The boats you are on are large and safe with bench seating. (Ok for some sitting on a metal bench seat may not be the most comfortable thing in the world, so if inclined, bring a seat pad.) The boats do have a roof, so you are not baking in the hot sun, and are shaded. Of course if it rains you are also protected, at least from above. Of course the sides are open air so you have better views. The trip on the boat is perhaps 1\/2 hour or 45 min. It is a fast paced trip with other tour guides getting on their radio and telling your boat captain where the gators can be seen, so it's very rare that you don't see a gator. There is gator show and explanation by the workers who are also TV stars in their own right on the nature and travel channels on TV, if you have ever seen \"Swamp People\" or \"Gator Boys\", this is the place they work! They do offer AAA discounts and I have seen coupons around town for discounts in addition to being in the Entertainment Book, so look for them. The savings can be great for this great trip!","img_urls":"","tour_time":"May 2014 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.422558Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T16:25:40.958113Z","inner_id":850,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2568,"annotations":[{"id":856,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":271,"end":281,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"38rb20zxtA","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-02T16:26:07.016644Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T16:26:07.016644Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-02T16:25:59.258361Z","lead_time":25.834,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"833248fb-d112-4b86-ac11-eb1c9fb49081","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2568,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Norm Jr Buffalo","user_hometown":"Buffalo, NY","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"A Good Half Day Adventure","content":"We enjoyed the experience.

Some of my friends in South Florida told me to check out EHP.  I went to Everglades Holiday Park for the airboat tour and alligator show. I thought the airboat tour was really informative and exciting. It was cool to learn some facts about the everglades as well as see demonstrations. My favorite part of the tour was seeing alligators up close (natural habitat).This was a memorable experience. We don't see alligators in Virginia, so I was fascinated. Our tour guide\/captain was very entertaining and showed us cool things. I learned a lot about surviving in the everglades. A souvenir picture is given to you after the airboat tour is over. The alligator show last about 20 minutes. A guy from the television shows \"Gator Boy\" do some stunts with different alligators. Guest is able to take pictures with baby alligators after the alligator show is over. Everglades Holiday Park was a priceless and memorable experience for me.

Thank You Staff...The Everglades Holiday Park has a variety of things to offer - Regular Air Boat Tours, Group & Private Air boat Tours, A really Good Gator Presentation, Animal Encounters and you can have your picture taken with Baby Gators. You can visit  Luna-Albino Gator and they offer a VIP-TOUR & Pick Up Service. The time for Tours runs from 09:00 AM - 5:00 PM (1700 HRS) departing every 20 minutes, 7 days a week. Rain or Shine!Also - A gift shop, bathrooms, picnic area, fishing dock, fishing boat rentals, boat ramps, a bait room and ramps for the Disabled - along with wheel chairs. Plenty of parking for everyone and parking for the Disabled.We had a Great Time and hope to return someday.

They are quite a pair.  She came out while we were there and swam around the boat close enough to photograph.The tour was great with Capt. Rick because he scoots the boat to go sideways so you get a breeze and see the entire area 360 degrees.

He took us through a few long stretches of water at a faster speed, which was enjoyable, than slowed down to look for the thing that I am Terrified of .. a Gator.

He also took us to see a family of purple gallinule birds.

We bought out tickets and only waited about 15 min for the next boat.  They fit 20-25 on each boat.  Thru take your picture before you get on the boat.  Make it count because the picture is actually free.  Yes, FREE!  They don't try to lure you in to buying it.  They just hand it to you in a cute little frame when you come back from your tour.  Try to sit on the end so you can see.  The boats have covers so that helps with the sun but it does kinda hinder your view if you are in the middle.  Boat feels very safe, even when going fast.

You get a gator show after the tour which is boring but nice that it helps the volunteers pay for college by collecting tips.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jun 2016","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.422558Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T02:55:47.354119Z","inner_id":955,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2673,"annotations":[{"id":961,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":4,"end":16,"text":"airboat tour","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"gCm8Qy1n4f","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":277,"end":327,"text":"numerous alligators (8-9) throughout our boat ride","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"GRr1DOg0nk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":329,"end":355,"text":"Birds and numerous iguanas","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"aonrA91zmB","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":448,"end":458,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"6aO3RY_8w3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":496,"end":575,"text":"one of the 'nuisance' gators had just been brought in by the team for us to see","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"pHq0eGE3Ob","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":612,"end":654,"text":"Concern for the wellbeing of these animals","labels":["bequest"]},"id":"fE0fMUwZX7","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-03T02:57:16.060137Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T02:57:16.060137Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-03T02:55:55.747092Z","lead_time":88.483,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"6d7e31b0-8003-4f92-a914-27392b884b65","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2673,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"SheralTx","user_hometown":"Amarillo, TX","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great idea to do this!","content":"Fun airboat tour.

Still, for me, if that is what it takes to get me and other newcomers to learn about life in the everglades and see the local animals, I'm fine with it!  I enjoyed the experience and learned a lot! I also went to another place up north more along the coast and learned other different things about the gators, so I can't say it was an inclusive sharing of info but good enough for me to enjoy for my first time! I'd enjoy it again as well! It went over the mentioned 2 hours it would be, and left me feeling I got my money's worth but glad I was not on a tight schedule. Also enjoyed the gator show afterward, while short, it was it's own thing and a good addition.  Our tour guide definitely had his own style and added to the trip.  And while a 'tough' guy with life's experiences, he was definitely very caring about giving tips to get in and out of the boat, and helpful to those with knee issues.

Bring water, as you will likely want it during the excursion, and remember to use the restroom before you go on your tour.  We did not get tickets ahead of time and did not have to wait long.  Seems they close around 5, so definitely plan to go before evening. You can get some unique (to me) food, gator and frog legs, but do it before the grill closes.

I have a 7, 6, & 4 year old.  We decided to skip a day an expensive day disney and see real florida instead.  So happy with our decision!  We started off with doing the \"Animal Encounter\" with our guide Emily.  She was the best, so patient and sweet with my curious kids.  We got to see and hold a gator, a sweet snake, a chocolate skunk (soooo cute!), and meet the cutest fox I have ever seen.  I paid the extra $10 to get all the pictures on a USB since you cannot get your own pictures, they will take them all for you (worth it!).  Emily took excellent pictures!  I don't know who liked this experience more my kids or my husband and I.  It was worth every penny! Thank you Emily for such a wonderful experience!! Then we hit the airboats for an hour long ride with Al, our airboat captain.  He was friendly, informative, and you can tell how much he respects and loves the everglades.  He showed us about 5-6 gators up close, iguanas, fish, and lots of birds.  Al let my kids feed a family of Gallinules (swamp chickens).  My little kids could see everything, there was plenty of room on the boat, we all felt very safe.  After the airboat ride we went in to watch Gabby wrestle a gator.  My kids are HUGE gator boys fans, the show is one of their favorites to watch.  They loved watching this in real life.  It was like seeing a celebrity for them!  Its amazing to see such courage and respect for such misunderstood animals.  After the show we got a picture with a baby gator.  The park is run really well, easy to navigate, and a must see!","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/b6\/2c\/65\/awesome-show.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/b6\/2c\/09\/all-smiles-for-gators.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/b6\/2b\/c3\/gabby-the-gatorgirl.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/b6\/2b\/6c\/animal-encounter.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/b6\/2b\/62\/animal-encounter.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Jan 2020","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.438024Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T03:46:46.758493Z","inner_id":985,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2703,"annotations":[{"id":991,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"Saw An alligator swim up to our boat","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"xGMt43zfPv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-03T03:47:05.475090Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T03:47:05.475090Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-03T03:46:57.477305Z","lead_time":18.498,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"363965f3-1399-4a25-bdef-ea1c137eff5d","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2703,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"micsolom","user_hometown":"Novi, MI","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Alligators!!!!","content":"Saw An alligator swim up to our boat!

The noise from the boats is really loud and I had to cover my babies ears with clothing.

We saw alligators and lots of other wildlife. The driver was very informative and excited about the area. The alligator show was animal friendly and informative. It was quite short but this felt fair to the animals and also to the volunteer running it. We had a short time to purchase food.

We saw several gators on our airboat ride.The gator show was a nice throw-in, but the airboat ride of ~ 1 hour was the main attraction.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jul 2016 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.440874Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T03:57:24.843711Z","inner_id":1009,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2727,"annotations":[{"id":1015,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":98,"end":117,"text":"alligator boat tour","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"cP9EojDG-X","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":541,"end":567,"text":"saw quite a few alligators","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"8VBvqWdcO_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":691,"end":716,"text":"seeing as many alligators","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"cUU_L_e1yr","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":722,"end":743,"text":"gator exhibition show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"LsQMyGe2rP","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1002,"end":1014,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"9aPoRXJzeq","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-03T03:58:30.927116Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T03:58:30.927116Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-03T03:57:37.592449Z","lead_time":64.968,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"c04e5a4a-6bf7-4426-90b3-f025515d3221","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2727,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"CaAfAm","user_hometown":"Boca Raton, FL","rating":"2.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Going down; down; down!","content":"OMG what a disappointment! As locals since 2008 we’ve taken multiple international guests to this alligator boat tour. It is becoming worse by the year. This year is the last time. So rude; loud and overbearing call to order over the loud speaker; overcharging by $80 because the cashier is so hasty; yelling at guests to remain in line as they’re trying to shelter from the rain; making guests stand in the rain until every person in the group has their photo taken. All this is happening while the staff took shelter on a covered deck. We saw quite a few alligators which was a win; but take a walk at any one of the many Everglades entry points and you’ll have a much more relaxing time; seeing as many alligators. The gator exhibition show was an improvement - the show was the same and seating was comfortable vs standing in the hot sun. To sum it up - the boat guide seemed not interested in the people nor animals; mumbled something through the speaker and steered the ‘what could be an exiting airboat ride’ into disappointment.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Sep 2018 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.440874Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T03:58:30.969941Z","inner_id":1010,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2728,"annotations":[{"id":1016,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":4,"end":16,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"bJmOoGWpWp","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":72,"end":93,"text":"explore he Everglades","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"OqNEbsXTwN","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":114,"end":124,"text":"saw Gators","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"fFB3rzYzYZ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":126,"end":139,"text":"fed the birds","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"At_Asc6AaY","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":176,"end":239,"text":"learned about the plants, snakes, and other animals in the area","labels":["educational"]},"id":"SUjbYTt7fu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":351,"end":376,"text":"navigating the Everglades","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"Swi286TsDL","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":551,"end":580,"text":"take photos with a baby gator","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"1f6BigKvSv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-03T03:59:11.150902Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T03:59:11.150902Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-03T03:58:39.615271Z","lead_time":39.175,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"c59c5a8a-9359-42c2-a6f7-e72a2c0abe96","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2728,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Ghada R","user_hometown":"Thousand Oaks, CA","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Quite an adventure!","content":"The airboat ride was so good.

I've been there by myself. While Florida's national park lacks the grandeur of the mountains and forests generally thought of when evoking national parks images - its river of grass is a magical wonder that for many requires focus to appreciate. Unfortunately, too many Floridians are transplants and never appreciate the unique swamp that is the \" real\" authentic original Florida.   Give your self a treat - bring your camera.  Take an airboat ride.  Unfortunately, Broward county took over the park which had been privately run by a colorful gang of rednecks for eons - but, a recent trip proved that they had not totally sucked the regional flavor out of the place.  I do miss the old redneck swamp men who used to run the boats - their bombast and colorful language their personal slant on swamp preservation is missed.  The bland county employees reading their script is pale fare.  But the river of grass is majestic in its subtle beauty - you cant take that away from her.

I highly suggest going and doing these activities and encourage you to bring extra cash for their tips since that is their only income.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jun 2018 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.440874Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T04:08:10.767886Z","inner_id":1026,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2744,"annotations":[{"id":1032,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":23,"end":53,"text":"airboat tour of the Everglades","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"U3fJbrapqo","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":417,"end":441,"text":"Identified lots of birds","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"-rzawso2Nt","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":453,"end":495,"text":"described a lot of the ecology of the area","labels":["educational"]},"id":"O6yOlkU6y7","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":553,"end":563,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"8D6L1AQZx7","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-03T04:09:03.413601Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T04:09:03.413601Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-03T04:08:21.188211Z","lead_time":51.534,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"ae2de087-189d-4823-8e82-5afcf393010d","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2744,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"judik","user_hometown":"Redmond, WA","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Wonderful Ecosystem","content":"Always wanted to do an airboat tour of the Everglades and finally got a chance to do so since I had a lot of time to kill before leaving on my flight early eveningPretty easy drive from the airport , ample parking on site Small restaurant on site as well as a convenience type store in the office where you bought your ticket Captain Cody, our captain, was extremely knowledgeable about the place that he grew up in.

I have previously tried airboat rides (with other airboat tour establishments) and had been really excited about these and wanted my family members to also have this nice experience. However, we were so very disappointed about our experience here. The type of airboat felt like being squeezed into a can. There was very limited visibility as it was not possible to look out of the plastik 'window' in the front of the boat and there was very limited views to both sides when sitting in the middle of the boat. The guide primarily focused on promoting himself and not so much about sharing his (most likely high) knowledge about the Everglades and wildlife. Before the airboat ride, we saw an alligator show. There were many alligators in the same and quite small confinement. When walking around the area and seeing the anmials in the cages, we were sorry to see the conditions of the cages which were small, seemed to be lacking maintenance and gave the impression that the animal needs had not been taken into consideration. In some instances it was difficult to see the animals properly due to the condition of the 'glass'. Especially the two foxes saddened us as they did not have much space and the cage was completely bare. The foxes were pacing back and forth. Photos were taken with a baby alligator. We felt so sorry for this little creature which was placed in the hands of many, many tourists who had a photo taken with them and the baby alligator. Altogether, we were left with a very disappointed and sad impression and experience.   Based on this experience, I would like to suggest the following considerations; - Other types of airboats allowing a full view of the sights- Smaller types of airboats for face-to-face contact with the guide which would also invite for more spontaneous questions and dialogue with the guide - Improved conditions for the caged animals","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jul 2023","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.440874Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T04:17:05.776800Z","inner_id":1037,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2755,"annotations":[{"id":1043,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":102,"end":146,"text":"a nice educational area with native wildlife","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"pCF6hTH44I","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-03T04:17:29.148406Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T04:17:29.148406Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":20.87,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"36dad2dc-df0e-4152-b7bf-88aba3089d41","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2755,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Joie B","user_hometown":"Lakeland, FL","rating":"2.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Not impressed!","content":"Stopped by on the way home from a JiuJitsu tournament and I was less then impressed!!

I was expecting more from the famous \"Gator Boys\"  of Animal Planet fame.  The gators were lethargic and the \"tricks\" were not that impressive.  A  pregnant woman came out afterwards with a baby gator that you could take a photo with for $3.  No one seemed interested.  One guy took a photo with an adult gator whose snout was taped up for $10.

While the animals may or may not show themselves during the trip, she worked hard to coax them out and make sure each side of the boat received ample time to take pictures and observe.  She was able to attract birds that know and trust her, and took her time to explain the most interesting items - not just your standard \"script\".  This is the second everglades airboat ride we've taken, with the other at another location.  In comparison, this location is much more commercial.  Pros:  more access to parking, food, restrooms, snacks, and a free group picture.  Cons:  more boats going out in short intervals, which creates more boats that you encounter during trip.  Capt. Tonya worked hard to create some separation between us and other boats to increase the likelihood that the animals would come out.  It worked - we saw a few alligators, iguana, birds and vegetation. We did not take advantage of the gator show which was part of the ticket price, as we would rather see wildlife in their natural habitat - not being asked to perform.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Apr 2016 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Everglades Holiday Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.440874Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T04:23:35.469496Z","inner_id":1050,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2768,"annotations":[{"id":1056,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":46,"end":58,"text":"airboat ride","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"sO3qe0vLA5","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":91,"end":108,"text":"saw one saw gator","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"wUQ0unxnDk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":114,"end":124,"text":"gator show","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"D7Yx-kPmAR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":200,"end":212,"text":"hold a gator","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"03OYLQKDLU","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-03T04:23:50.722151Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T04:23:55.021625Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-03T04:23:44.847927Z","lead_time":17.999,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"3c20647a-f62b-4f2f-b15e-0cc5e6b457cc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2768,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Debra G","user_hometown":"Jupiter, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"So much fun","content":"The entire family enjoyed the entire day.

Airboat captain was great and very knowledgeable about the wildlife and history of the Everglades.  Tour felt a little longer than it needed to be and if we didn't have other plans that day, maybe not such a big deal.  Compared to another nearby Airboat tour company, Everglades Holiday Park airboat tours are about 2x as long (hour vs. 1\/2 hour).  Tips were mentioned toward the end of the ride, not pushy, just blah... not really what you want to hear after spending $50 for 1 adult and 1 child ticket.  Gator Boys Gator Show was very cool....however, the constant mentioning of \"Tips are appreciated\" grew old quickly.  Fun, somewhat educational show, lots of laughs from the audience, but jeez...please back a bit on the frequent requests for tips.  Focus on the show and performance and the tips will follow. *Opportunity to take pics with an Alligator and snake after the show... $10 for 1 animal or $15 for both.  Fair deal for the experience and the pic is provided.  We were ready to leave though and after the frequent push for tips, I didn't want to reach back into my pocket.

I primarily come here to run. There is not a lot of visible wildlife compared to some of the other nature centers in the area although I have seen butterflies, raccoons, armadillos, and a really large land turtle on the grassy plains part in the way back. When you first enter you follow an elevated boardwalk to the two story visitors center. The lower level has a ranger station with some educational displays. To the left is an amphitheater with bench seating. On weekends I have seen folk concerts and weddings held here. Also on the lower level you will find the bathrooms and water fountains. The second floor is a reception area called Royal Fern Hall complete with a kitchen that can be rented for weddings and meetings. Every Halloween they do a nice program for the kiddies up there. Once a week they also offer yoga in the park. There is a sign advertising it at the entrance from Lyons Road.Once you go around the visitors center you will come to a small gate that will take you out to the paths. The path to the left is the Cypress Creek Trail. It is a half mile elevated boardwalk that loops back around to the start. This is the only good area for a wheelchair. The path to the right takes you over a small bridge and out to the back field and a path that goes through the woods. Here you will find the one mile Prairie Overlook Trail that has a small elevated covered observation platform with benches. Maps for everything are at the visitors center. If you come here you want to make absolutely sure that nothing is left visible in your car. There has been a number of break ins primarily taking place later in the day towards closing time when there are less people around. You also want to bring some bug spray with you especially if you plan on going through the woods. The last time I was here this month was not bad but I have been here when the mosquitoes were so thick I literally ran for my life. This a great and cheap (no fee) place to relax in nature and decompress from the stress of the work week.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Feb 2018 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Fern Forest Nature Center"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.440874Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T17:13:16.905998Z","inner_id":1068,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2786,"annotations":[{"id":1074,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":112,"end":127,"text":"boardwalk trail","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"p3_sBcjQSF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":166,"end":196,"text":"see some of Florida's wildlife","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"CFpUv1tjjy","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":199,"end":289,"text":"The other trails take you through a thick forest which leads up to a nice, elevated gazebo","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"02FePpN_5o","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":367,"end":387,"text":"educational seminars","labels":["educational"]},"id":"QoC27Lsjwx","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":403,"end":444,"text":"a venue for parties and special occasions","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"_jCIjIlqsa","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":516,"end":620,"text":"bring your camera and\/or smartphone, you'll want to capture some of South Florida's beautiful ecosystems","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"TqhXSLIheA","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-03T17:14:26.979607Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T17:14:26.979607Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-03T17:13:30.288533Z","lead_time":69.823,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"7f4848c9-b735-474e-9624-e5492d7dd885","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2786,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Jasper F","user_hometown":"Pompano Beach, FL","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Hidden Gem","content":"Decided to explore Fern Forest and was pleasantly surprised at just how stunningly beautiful a park it is.

I would also recommend bringing insect repellent as it can be quite wet at times.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jun 2013 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Fern Forest Nature Center"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.440874Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T17:14:27.025572Z","inner_id":1069,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2787,"annotations":[{"id":1075,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":59,"end":73,"text":"elevated walks","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"lkMFoCoKmB","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":88,"end":99,"text":"nature view","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"KotDF2sGqi","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":104,"end":123,"text":"tons of butterflies","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"NQh1rBVThS","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-03T17:14:50.008758Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T17:14:50.008758Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-03T17:14:42.253891Z","lead_time":22.746,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"210fc9f0-6cdc-4602-b24f-0273fa266f34","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2787,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Robert B","user_hometown":"San Antonio, TX","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Wet but beautiful","content":"Don't spend money and time going to butterfly center.

Very cool. There were also decent sized fish in the creeks on the way there too. On the perimeter trail there is a large overlook where you can see much of the park and the beautiful trees. The trail then makes a loop and you come back to the grassy path that takes you to the visitor center. You can try to then take the Maple Trail- but at your own risk! It was very muddy and narrow when I went and there was a sign saying 'increased mosquito activity'. Thankfully, at the entrance to the boardwalk section there is a shoe-wash stationBest of all, this is all FREE! Even parking was free.

There is also a bathroom nearby.This lot is probably about a 1 mile walk away from all of the \"action\" (restaurants and bars) on the Boardwalk.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Nov 2016 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Hollywood North Beach Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.440874Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T03:12:30.326126Z","inner_id":1098,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2816,"annotations":[{"id":1104,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":4,"end":42,"text":"hammocks with the dense varied foliage","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"7cOdehtvX4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":44,"end":55,"text":"great paths","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"TfGr-foXJK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":60,"end":92,"text":"incredible scattered beach homes","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"1JEb9Ex44a","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":103,"end":121,"text":"great daily stroll","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"XiXqnbN_nJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":126,"end":134,"text":"wildlife","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"uKsbXNzw6T","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":139,"end":164,"text":"avid activity enthusiasts","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"9c5SOyfNuL","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-04T03:16:24.198972Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T03:16:24.198972Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-04T03:15:19.725420Z","lead_time":150.348,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"bd085398-3cef-4360-abd5-4e1ec898a89f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2816,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"melgartraci","user_hometown":"Bardstown, KY","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"A step into nature","content":"The hammocks with the dense varied foliage, great paths and incredible scattered beach homes provide a great daily stroll.The wildlife and avid activity enthusiastsprovide intriguing balance.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jun 2015 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Hollywood North Beach Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.440874Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T03:16:24.243062Z","inner_id":1099,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2817,"annotations":[{"id":1105,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":76,"end":96,"text":"beaches are peaceful","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"7uJL6UakaL","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":150,"end":170,"text":"pack a picnic basket","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"7ADFD2svEL","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-04T03:21:39.623627Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T03:21:39.623627Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-04T03:21:32.887889Z","lead_time":17.342,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"0c33f8c0-04f7-4525-ad25-149b57fdde01","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2817,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Arkapino","user_hometown":"Hollywood, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Quiet beach away from the chaos.","content":"If you prefer quiet to the chaos of the Broadwalk, this is your place.

Next time, we'll bring a cooler with frozen ice water.On the plus side... the water was clear and azure blue. The sea floor was nice rippled sand, no rocks or hard surfaces.  The seashells and coral pieces on shore during low tide were fantastic! I got lots of specimens I haven't found at other beaches in Florida. It was not crowded, maybe 30-40 other people.

It reminded me more of the beaches at Venice, in Los Angeles, but more polished and built up. The Broadwalk aka Boardwalk, it like the one in Venice, paved and goes on from this park southwards to nearly Jefferson St, after that, it is just beach. Whatever you do, park at the North Beach Park ( depending on the day, cost is $1.50 to 2 bucks an hour, or $15 all day. There is no attendant, so take money for the machine. You want to to walk, jog, skate from one end of the walk to the other, it is a very wide boardwalk lined with palms. Stunning. The ocean will be at least 80F. The park is one of the larger public facilities located just after Sherman st going north along the A1A or N. Ocean drive. This is where the trolley ends and then returns to Crowne Plaza near Hallandale Beach Blvd. The park has all the facilities you need to change, restroom, places to eat string the boardwalk. Because the beaches line the shore for many, many miles, this park is not crowded. For public garages, these are located at the Hollywood Beach Marriott between Carolina and Taft st. Not far from the park. There is a garage between Garfield and Connecticut St also, near a much smaller park called Charnow park, Not far and is a good walk is the beautiful Hollywood Marina it begins at Michigan st and ends at Poik st. Hollywood is only 20 miles north of Miami. You can also check out the Anne Kolb nature Center, which is across from the park on Sheridan St. If you go a little more south, there is West Lake Park where you can rent kayaks and canoes and explore the intracoastal waterway. So, this park is a good central location for these other activities. five miles down the road, north, is John Lloyd State Beach park.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/04\/1d\/8a\/6c\/hollywood-north-beach.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Jun 2013 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Hollywood North Beach Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.456265Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T04:12:06.885312Z","inner_id":1106,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2824,"annotations":[{"id":1112,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":37,"end":68,"text":"a boardwalk for biking, walking","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"b0Lu7CUIwE","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-04T04:05:04.976083Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T04:05:04.976083Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":8.422,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"bb731224-bf71-425c-bfe8-d50c37615130","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2824,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Pinqylou","user_hometown":"Jacksonville, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Real Florida","content":"This is a beautiful county park with a boardwalk for biking, walking, etc. The beach is clean and easily accessible.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Feb 2016 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Hollywood North Beach Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.456265Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T04:05:05.018627Z","inner_id":1107,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2825,"annotations":[{"id":1113,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":56,"end":91,"text":"a magical nesting area for turtles","labels":["scientiﬁc"]},"id":"4uySxcFUHJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":113,"end":192,"text":"walk the nests and assist in helping the hatchlings find their way to the ocean","labels":["scientiﬁc"]},"id":"Wj5cAankNu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":245,"end":257,"text":"walking area","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"GLNv916LR5","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":262,"end":284,"text":"a great hideaway beach","labels":["existence"]},"id":"Wnp8ibrTqC","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-04T04:06:40.096631Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T04:11:36.956974Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-04T04:06:03.062890Z","lead_time":97.994,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"ff473884-c8ed-4871-a185-8b9f2c44890c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2825,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"julytripfamily16","user_hometown":"Hollywood, FL","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Real beach","content":"All good!

You can expect to see vegetation like slash pine, saw palmetto, beautyberry, swamp and sword fern, wax myrtle, and yellowtop. Events held here include eco action day held on the fourth Saturday of the month October through May when volunteers remove invasive species of plants. There are also nature at night hikes and school group and scouting programs. Some of the events are tacked to a board by the bathrooms and a listing can also be found on the website. If you can't arrange for a guided tour you can take a self guided tour with the enaturalist which are signs along the trail with a QR code. When I snapped a picture of one it took me to a YouTube video that described the area I was in. This is another great little natural area that gets you outdoors and exercising. You might not notice it from 441 as you drive past but it is worth a visit.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/6e\/9b\/68\/hillsboro-pineland-natural.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/6e\/9b\/69\/hillsboro-pineland-natural.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/6e\/9b\/6b\/hillsboro-pineland-natural.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/6e\/9b\/6c\/hillsboro-pineland-natural.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/6e\/9b\/6d\/hillsboro-pineland-natural.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/6e\/9b\/70\/hillsboro-pineland-natural.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/6e\/9b\/72\/hillsboro-pineland-natural.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/6e\/9b\/73\/hillsboro-pineland-natural.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/6e\/9b\/74\/hillsboro-pineland-natural.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/6e\/9b\/75\/hillsboro-pineland-natural.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Mar 2018 • Solo","UGS":"Broward_Kristin Jacobs Natural Area at Hillsboro Pineland"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.456265Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T04:19:40.397411Z","inner_id":1117,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2835,"annotations":[{"id":1123,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":277,"end":298,"text":"high-quality walkways","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"dZDtKIUZE_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":304,"end":353,"text":"better-than-average exhibits in the nature center","labels":["educational"]},"id":"irJ4Af_zXL","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":368,"end":396,"text":"odd modernistic sitting area","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"gFkxtFuoQJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":488,"end":511,"text":"among the fauna & flora","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"FZfefid2Hc","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-04T04:21:06.907090Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T04:21:06.907090Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-04T04:20:34.141113Z","lead_time":82.127,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"0dfed87a-eef3-4e0e-91a3-11a9f7696834","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2835,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Lorna B.","user_hometown":"Bechtelsville, PA","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"peaceful, lovely setting","content":"We enjoyed our visit to this nature center.

There is also a primitive camping site. We tent camped, the site included water, electricity, and even Wi-Fi. The campground includes a bathhouse and dump station. The sites are pretty well spaced and we were lucky enough to have four of the sites next to us open. A tip, the most northern sites of the campground are the one's closest to the shooting range. Also, if you camp over the weekend be sure to stop by the Fox Observatory.

Bought all the gear thinking that it would be good weather and would be great; however it decided to rain the first night and it was so humid that the mosquitoes formed a virtual blanket over everything. I guess they can't do much about the mosquitoes, but I didn't appreciate stumbling across red ant hills that seemed to be all over our campsite and among the grass on the side of the road to get to the bathrooms. Speaking of the bathrooms- very poor! No air conditioning so you sweat every minute you are in there. Women's room ran out of toilet paper the first night. Second day when we took showers the women's room was OK, but in the men's room one shower only had cold water and the other was too scalding to use. We opted not to give our three year old a shower for that reason. Got woken up at the crack of dawn by the sound of gunfire from the shootingrange.I suppose if you go in a travel trailer or RV and you have your own bathroom and a couple of bikes to explore the area it probably wouldn't be too bad, but I would never recommend it for tent camping!","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jan 2015","UGS":"Broward_Markham Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.456265Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T18:50:17.076911Z","inner_id":1134,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2852,"annotations":[{"id":1140,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":5,"end":15,"text":"bike trail","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"eqHENGPRJA","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":111,"end":134,"text":"Nice place for a picnic","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"iRQTqE-UmT","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":136,"end":161,"text":"Watch the model airplanes","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"honTd3OADE","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-04T18:50:40.421761Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T18:50:40.421761Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-04T18:50:34.325362Z","lead_time":14.063,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"a21fa841-d68c-4408-b252-15aff8f03068","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2852,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"JudyMK","user_hometown":"New Ulm, MN","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Nice park","content":"Good bike trail just outside the park.

It's a good place to go camping and there is an RV park.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Apr 2016","UGS":"Broward_Markham Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.456265Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T19:04:00.537715Z","inner_id":1150,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2868,"annotations":[{"id":1156,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":192,"end":223,"text":"lake for boats and wave-runners","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"8l2MjJaYhd","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":225,"end":244,"text":"mountain bike track","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"lbBwKbo5Oo","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":265,"end":294,"text":"shooting range, R\/C airplanes","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"TA_OrpD-XI","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":296,"end":309,"text":"hiking trails","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"tvKrv-ugHY","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":312,"end":347,"text":"dog park, playgrounds, camping area","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"2gkWOh8WWX","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":246,"end":263,"text":"canal access ramp","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"bKcjXPJ1bN","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":599,"end":612,"text":"RV campground","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"UdE6P3Tcq_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-04T19:09:08.765253Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T19:09:08.765253Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-04T19:08:20.726705Z","lead_time":251.852,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"76f04554-ae0a-445c-b1eb-288f6eed0ed8","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2868,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Francisco A","user_hometown":"Weston, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Incredible Park in Broward County!!!","content":"This is a huge park located at the end of Weston road, it is into Sunrise city limits but some people still call it Weston because of its proximity.

Definitely worth the trip. To enter the mountain biking trail which is the only way to see the nest, I went to the office and paid around $5.00.

He seemed to be in \"la la land.\" It was really quite awkward. Secondly, the security person who patrolled the campground at night in their vehicle must have assumed my friend and I were there illegally, because we chose a site away from the crowd. Instead of addressing this false assumption in a professional manner (as in, actually getting out of his vehicle to see our campsite pass was clearly sitting in my car's dashboard), this guy blew his horn several times and shined a spot-light at our tent at 11:30pm and again around 1am...when we were just in our tent trying to sleep!!!Thirdly, when we called the campground manager to address our issues with the security guard, she did not seem to be genuinely concerned.Other than the late-night disruption, I am moderately pleased with my experience at Quiet Waters Campground. I don't know that I would stay here again.

It has several well maintained trails, all short walks into different areas.  The New River Trail winds around among white, black and red mangrove trees to the river where we saw 5 manatees.  Beautiful!!  The red mangrove trees look like stick trees walking on water.The Butterfly garden trail is a very short walk full of plants that attract butterflies.The Laurel Oak Trail has beautiful Strangler Fig trees, one hosting a rather large wild comb of honeybees.  Has a exhibit center full of things for kids to see and touch.  Including several snakes and an active contained bee hive with and entrance in\/out of the building.Has Geocaching!  Tons of fun.Kids- there is also a trail that would be great for kids of all ages.  At the beginning there is a box with a small pack of paper for them.  Then in short intervals there are etching stations.  They place their paper over a metal type sign post and with the attached metal bar they rub it over the paper and it \"etches\" the picture on their page.  Each one with a different plant or animal to etch into their paper book.Staff- super knowledgable and willing to assist in answering questions.  Took a nature tour with naturalist Scott, he shared history facts, interesting factoids about plants and animals.  He really knows his stuff and answered our endless questions.  Opened from 9-5, free parking, no entrance fee.Truly a secret Woods!  A must for nature lovers to take pictures and learn!  Also to pass time before\/after cruising or going to the airport.Tip- long pants or bug spray was helpful to us.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Feb 2015 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Secret Woods Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.456265Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T00:42:21.421392Z","inner_id":1222,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2940,"annotations":[{"id":1228,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":60,"end":71,"text":"a nice walk","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"zU7bLVbNIY","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":78,"end":99,"text":"communing with nature","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"64Tk5yR3qo","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":111,"end":120,"text":"boardwalk","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"02fLDF49XF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":126,"end":167,"text":"takes you through mangroves and the river","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"zBJrmjjO-2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":189,"end":247,"text":"covered with canopy of trees it stays cool and comfortable","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"4t1ur66M1o","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":176,"end":185,"text":"boardwalk","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"NGlw7QsuiP","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":322,"end":358,"text":"enjoyed running around the boardwalk","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"8ttd75WgVZ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":364,"end":481,"text":"nature center had a few live reptiles on display as well as a manatee skeleton and lots of other educational displays","labels":["educational"]},"id":"SDFmcQCJtV","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-06T00:48:41.773076Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T00:48:41.773076Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-06T00:47:53.151098Z","lead_time":380.119,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"64071d54-e3cb-4569-a427-ed1255613932","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2940,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"JordanL71","user_hometown":"Northbrook, IL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great place to spend a little time with nature, especially with kids.","content":"We visited this morning with our two young children and had a nice walk while communing with nature.

It is worth spending a few pleasant hours.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"","UGS":"Broward_Secret Woods Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.471276Z","updated_at":"2023-12-09T18:14:58.580918Z","inner_id":1229,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2947,"annotations":[{"id":1235,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":54,"end":88,"text":"Butterflies, birds, trees, flowers","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"gLlQ6a92J-","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":93,"end":176,"text":"more that are quickly being destroyed and replaced by shopping centers, condos, etc","labels":["bequest"]},"id":"xawojgIE7U","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":178,"end":232,"text":"Take a few minutes to see and explore the REAL Florida","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"oEFN30v16q","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-09T18:23:03.663260Z","updated_at":"2023-12-09T18:23:03.663260Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-09T18:16:23.220943Z","lead_time":478.555,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"a3c32c43-857b-4d25-82c2-e58dba7f4d9e","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2947,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Paul E","user_hometown":"143 contributions","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"A Piece of Natural South Florida","content":"Secret Woods Nature Center is a piece of old Florida.

I was in the area to get some shopping done so I decided to check out this area in the hopes of getting some fitbit steps in. There are a few parking spots and picnic tables in the lot. Before you enter the trail there is a bathroom, a feature I always appreciate. On the other side of the bathroom is a few benches set up so people can give nature talks. Before you start your walk you can download the eNaturalist Program on your phone to get a self guided tour.The entire area is 66 acres. The trail is on an elevated boardwalk over basin swamps and pine flatwood. It reminded me a lot of Fern Forest Nature Center but smaller. The trail winds through the Cypress area so you are never sure what you are going to see around the corner. There are two covered pavilions that lookout onto the natural area. There is also a small pond and waterway that runs along part of the boardwalk. I didn't see any wildlife but I was walking quickly for exercise. I find that if you want to see animals you have to really linger. Nevertheless it was a nice walk on a beautiful morning. Bird walks are held September through June and there are nature at night hikes October through May. A full schedule can be found online at Broward.org under the parks and recreation heading.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Feb 2018 • Solo","UGS":"Broward_Tall Cypress Natural Area"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.472019Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T20:57:59.265372Z","inner_id":1237,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2955,"annotations":[{"id":1243,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":41,"end":88,"text":"do the boardwalk and hike the trail in the back","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"R8K0_x03n2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":169,"end":191,"text":"going on the boardwalk","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"40-I9ktmFu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":268,"end":304,"text":"hiking trail by walking out the gate","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"InjYiAJGZH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":337,"end":368,"text":"walking all the way to the back","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"8kmQSDlriV","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":417,"end":437,"text":"see the hiking trail","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"6X7WE_gYki","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":550,"end":632,"text":"see lots of warblers, butterflies, woodpeckers and maybe even the great horned owl","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"134tVg71wx","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":653,"end":712,"text":"see the great horned owl and a huge flock of cedar waxwings","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"ZPSE9ZPdqK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-11T20:59:55.687604Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T21:01:23.778371Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-11T20:59:09.392688Z","lead_time":64.449,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"8f76bbc2-f621-4311-ada3-f66c8f2bf358","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2955,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"MarciaAbrahams1","user_hometown":"Bayside, NY","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"A good place for birding, but make sure that you don't go alone!

I didn't like it the first two times when I limited myself to just going on the boardwalk, and thanks to a friend, found out about the other area. You can get to the hiking trail by walking out the gate, making a left turn (north) and walking all the way to the back. Then make your left and go inside and you will see the hiking trail. In this section in season and at the right time (meaning early morning or before dusk around 5:00 PM), you may see lots of warblers, butterflies, woodpeckers and maybe even the great horned owl.

I was in the area, and admission was free on non-holiday weekdays so I stopped in. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of wildlife: the most I have ever seen at this location. In just over an hour I saw an abundance of birds (egrets, herons, ibis, wood storks, cormorants, ducks, moorhens, coots), squirrels, and lizards (anoles and iguanas). It is a nice hike around the massive lake, or just to relax under the shade of the abundant oak trees. There had recently been a tropical storm, so the lake had overflowed some areas of the park that had to be detoured around. There were unfortunately a few negatives. Upon arriving I noticed that a homeless person living in a car overflowing with junk had obstructed part of the parking lot with their vehicle and was begging for change with a large sign saying, \"We may be homeless, but we are still Christian\" Yet no park staff were removing this illegal panhandler. While hiking the trail up a hill, I came close to being run over by a group riding loud motorbikes on the trails and grass around the lake, despite motor vehicles being prohibited on the hiking trails. I observed an employee in a truck eventually stop them and told them more than once to leave, but were ignored and taunted. At one point the employee chased them with the truck, but I don't know why they didn't just call the police to arrest those punks. The third negative was that the shoreline all around the lake was completely littered with trash, yet I saw no employees making any effort to remove it.  Despite the negatives, I will still return, and I hope the Broward County Parks & Rec makes changes based on this review.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/79\/18\/i-was-very-disappointed.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/4b\/flooded-cabbage-palms.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/56\/flooded-oaks-submerged.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/5b\/flooded-oaks.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/60\/resurrection-ferns.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/67\/virginia-creeper.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/77\/florida-holly.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/7a\/gray-squirrel.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/7c\/american-coot.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/7e\/tricolored-heron.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/7f\/woos-stork.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/80\/muscovy-duck.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/84\/white-ibis.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/85\/common-gallinules.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/86\/green-iguana.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/87\/brown-anole.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1c\/52\/76\/8a\/muscadine-grape.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Nov 2020","UGS":"Broward_Topeekeegee Yugnee Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.472019Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T21:13:50.293985Z","inner_id":1241,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2959,"annotations":[{"id":1247,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":117,"end":145,"text":"surrounded by huge oak trees","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"lET4bU4cWR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":148,"end":190,"text":"has picnic tables & pavilions on the water","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"AbsuazVYZh","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":238,"end":295,"text":"go to a huge open field area perfect for games and sports","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"hazTpIQhCm","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":336,"end":391,"text":"see great playground areas for kids & even a water park","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"8kgutI8qbQ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":400,"end":488,"text":"like walking there is a great path all the way around the park, most goes along the lake","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"FIA2O9vdeJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-11T21:14:40.006734Z","updated_at":"2023-12-12T03:20:15.617956Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-11T21:14:18.302066Z","lead_time":55.742,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"0d41d57f-6176-4062-959d-9ad2d6bbcd3c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2959,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Carolyn M","user_hometown":"Hollywood, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Favorite park","content":"TY park is our favorite park.

First impression, the park is large, plenty of parking and secluded areas to BBQ, have family gatherings, parties, ect. The main office personnel were cordial and helpful checking in. The parking spots are plentiful and large. The initial problem we had was that the “full hook-up stations were on the correct side but almost at the left entry corner of the parking spot making it impossible to park near it without your rig sticking out of the parking spot; in other words, to park correctly you will need about 30 feet of water hose, tank drains, electrical, and cable. The other unusual issue is that if you park close to the “hook-ups”, your park bench is on the opposite side of the hook-ups but halfway into the parking spot, so your awning does not open over, or near the park table.Next, there is a walking\/running track that runs along the RV park fence (4-feet high) so there is all kinds of traffic (bicycles, rollerblades, running, walking, and everything else) passing by looking into the RV Park. This explains why in their brochure they warn all RVers to lock everything up when not on site; perhaps anyone can jump or use the “open gates on the fence to access the RV Park and no one would even know. Security drives by often and do there best to keep an eye out, but the RV Park is not isolate or has control access. Anyone can just drive or walk right in.There is a building at the center of the RV Park with Men, Woman, Family, RV Park bathroom’s with Key-Code access and the laundry room with six washers and dryers; anyone can just walk in to use them. Now our experience. My wife and I went to use the restrooms during the day and there were several ladies sitting at an outside park table just waiting for someone, in this case my wife, to use the bathrooms so they can gain access (they did not have the code or looked like they were camping there) to use the showers\/restrooms. I walked in the “Men’s showers\/restroom and bout bathroom stalls were occupied, one guy using the sink, and two using the showers; they looked like they were all related with the ladies outside. I reported it to the desk, they said they would send someone out, no one showed up! The bathrooms are cleaned once a day; hope you get to them early!All in all, it worked for us, but we were constantly concerned with the busy traffic walking by all day long. I would recommend the park management look into upgrading the RV Park security perimeter by increasing the track fence higher and a controlled (keypad) gate at the RV Park entrance to prevent casual walkers\/runners or family gathering people to use the RV Park facilities.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/18\/95\/d4\/fe\/photo0jpg.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/18\/95\/d4\/ff\/photo1jpg.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/18\/95\/d5\/00\/photo2jpg.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Jul 2019 • Couples","UGS":"Broward_Topeekeegee Yugnee Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.472717Z","updated_at":"2023-12-12T03:05:04.496383Z","inner_id":1257,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2975,"annotations":[{"id":1263,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":83,"end":99,"text":"fish in the lake","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"vD06Vghqxx","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":24,"end":79,"text":"Plenty of space to relax and enjoy the sun or the shade","labels":["experiential_use"]},"id":"1FY7giIg0K","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":101,"end":135,"text":"A walking path goes along the lake","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"nIAfuIcvh8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":136,"end":156,"text":"past the campgrounds","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"XsAtlt2Kqc","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-12T03:07:05.311210Z","updated_at":"2023-12-12T03:07:05.311210Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-12T03:06:48.757874Z","lead_time":120.593,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"a9c50efc-9642-47f3-82db-bec9f373f062","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2975,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Denise R","user_hometown":"Fort Lauderdale, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great place","content":"I go here all the time.

It is located on Sheridan Street, just off I-95. As I was already exploring nearby John Williams Park, I decided to visit this location on the way home. Unlike John Williams Park, this park however greedily charges a fee to enter. They even invested more taxpayer money into constructing a turnpike like toll plaza at the entrance. The public should not be extorted to allow their children to experience nature. This was the only negative. The centerpiece of the park is the huge lake in the center which has a hiking\/jogging trail surrounding the perimeter. Wildlife was plentiful. As we hiked we observed moorhens, dragonflies, butterflies, and gray squirrels. Fishing is allowed on the lake. There is also a playground, RV Park, Campground, Water Park, picnic areas under oak tree shade, and areas for sports activities. As we were pressed for time, we did not have a chance to explore the entire park, but hope to return.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/32\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/38\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/3c\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/3f\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/45\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/46\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/4d\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/51\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/54\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/58\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/5b\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/1f\/75\/5f\/topeekeegee-yugnee-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Oct 2015 • Friends","UGS":"Broward_Topeekeegee Yugnee Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.473731Z","updated_at":"2023-12-12T14:37:57.787865Z","inner_id":1286,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3004,"annotations":[{"id":1292,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":70,"end":131,"text":"great scenery , local wildlife, beautiful trees provide shade","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"dmAxXRysio","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":136,"end":178,"text":"pavilions make for a perfect party station","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"HMeM6MLVYl","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-12T14:38:15.947405Z","updated_at":"2023-12-12T14:38:15.947405Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":17.939,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"f1c51a2c-ea16-4041-bc8e-23f17295351b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3004,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Fayesky","user_hometown":"Hollywood, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Great place for annual family reunion","content":"My family has an annual family reunion here and it never disappoints, great scenery , local wildlife, beautiful trees provide shade and pavilions make for a perfect party station,","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Jul 2018 • Family","UGS":"Broward_Topeekeegee Yugnee Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.473731Z","updated_at":"2023-12-12T14:38:15.990185Z","inner_id":1287,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3005,"annotations":[{"id":1293,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3,"end":19,"text":"like the animals","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"PkQ-3VaFdJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":21,"end":32,"text":"playgrounds","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"RDc7H1EAvR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-12T14:38:40.305235Z","updated_at":"2023-12-12T14:38:40.305235Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-12T14:38:30.473528Z","lead_time":24.115,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"2f1b896b-2de4-4af1-9ef2-f6a8a7925709","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3005,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Craig K","user_hometown":"Coconut Creek, FL","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"this is a great park for all ages!","content":"We like the animals, playgrounds, trains you can ride on (2 days a month). the family and I have had a blast there.

If you don't care for a gym membership this outdoor \"gym\" is the answer.This park was a landfill over 20 years ago. That's why there is a noticeable elevation of about 70 feet. Those looking for a good workout can run or cycle up and down the hill.There are trails on the hill for walking, jogging and running. On the lower elevation, these is a designated trail\/path a little under a mile long with about 10 exercise stations. These are sturdy and well-built exercise machines that can be used for upper body and leg exercises. (See photos below.)There are also basketball courts, play areas for kids, pavilions\/shelters, 2 fishing decks, specific areas for model airplanes, drones, remote controlled cars and paragliding.There are few trees at this park so you won't find many birds like at Tree Tops Park nearby. However I have seen Cattle Egrets, Great Herons, Burrowing Owls, Northern Mockingbirds, Anhinga and ducks here.On the fourth of July the park is open late allowing you to see fireworks miles away in cities like Fort Lauderdale, Pembroke Pines and Miramar.The park is close to Griffin Road and I-75. Admission is free during the week and $1.50 per person on weekends and holidays.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/ac\/28\/ac\/vista-view-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/ac\/2a\/7c\/vista-view-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/ac\/2a\/80\/vista-view-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/ac\/3a\/91\/vista-view-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/ac\/fd\/30\/vista-view-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/ac\/fd\/37\/vista-view-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/09\/ac\/fd\/3b\/vista-view-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Oct 2015 • Solo","UGS":"Broward_Vista View Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.573853Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T04:03:23.906102Z","inner_id":1345,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3063,"annotations":[{"id":1351,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":94,"end":110,"text":"bringing my dogs","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"RtgJeAR38q","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":137,"end":156,"text":"runners, and bikers","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"pLzJcp60Zx","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":162,"end":174,"text":"horse riders","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"UwusfKN1DI","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-13T04:04:45.705819Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T04:04:45.705819Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-13T04:04:38.392810Z","lead_time":81.581,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"801db0f6-3ad6-4c28-8816-a15070840476","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3063,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"June6821","user_hometown":"Davie, FL","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Mountain in Florida","content":"I like that it has elevation, wish there were more tree's because the sun gets harsh.

One of them is open to the public, with a road to the top and parking there as well. The other hill is still fenced off. Maybe one day it will be open to the public. There is a very nice breeze at the top of the hill on almost every day. If you want to relax under a tree enjoying the breeze, well good luck. There aren't that many trees on the top.

That's important for safety especially since it's dark out and different groups are going at slightly different paces. The house beer is only $1.99 for a 16 oz - and it's a GOOD beer! I recommend arriving early enough to enjoy a beer before heading out. I also recommend bringing a waterproof box or bag for your valuables (keys, money, etc). And a d-clip to secure it.

It has lovely trees, benches, tables, and a stunning view of the river and the surrounding mansions that line it. There are a few parking spots lining the outside of the park.On my visit while walking around I discovered a plaque placed by the Daughters of the American Revolution commemorating this park as the sight of the Colee Hammock Massacre. I knew about the event and always thought the location was across the river from the Broward Performing Arts Center. I was floored to find the marker and have my years of misconception corrected. William Cooley was one of the first pioneers of the New River Settlement now known as Ft. Lauderale. He became wealthy with an arrowroot plantation and he traded with Seminole and Creek nations nearby. In 1835 the white settlers killed a Creek chief named Alibama and were acquitted. The Creek blamed Cooley for this injustice and when he was away for business in Key West the Creek entered the plantation on January 6, 1836 and killed Cooley's wife, infant son, son, daughter,and a tutor. The house was set on fire. This started the Second Seminole War because the settlers couldn't distinguish between the Seminoles and the Creeks. The eventual outcome was the Indian Removal Act were the native people were forced out west on the Trail of Tears. The remaining Seminoles fled to the inner swampland where they can still be found today. Cooley fled Ft. Lauderdale but lived in Florida until his death.Upon further research I found that the plaque marking the massacre may have been put in the wrong spot as the event actually took place further up the river closer to Sailboat Bend but residents don't want it moved to the correct spot. This is not the only muddling of history at this spot. Residents were confused at the time of the naming of this park in 1934. They originally wanted to honor the Cooley family but there was some confusion about the name. James Louis Colee was also a resident of the New River Settlement but decades after Cooley. He set up a work camp at the site of this park where he worked on the construction of  the Intracoastal Waterway project. Through the years the names of Cooley and Colee have been mixed up. In 1982 the park was officially named Colee Hammock park to reflect James Lois Colee's work camp not the Cooley massacre.Today the park is used as a spot to take in the waterway, fish, and climb the trees. It is also an ideal place to view the Winterfest Boat Parade if you can navigate the lack of parking. I found it an ideal place to reflect on the history of Ft. Lauderdale which has grown from a small trading settlement on the river to a world class city. In the span of roughly 100 years from when it was incorporated into a city in 1911 Ft. Lauderdale has changed yet it was managed to hang onto it's charm in part because of places like this park.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/2a\/4b\/b4\/88\/colee-hammock-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/2a\/4b\/b4\/87\/colee-hammock-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/2a\/4b\/b4\/85\/colee-hammock-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/2a\/4b\/b4\/84\/colee-hammock-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/2a\/4b\/b4\/83\/colee-hammock-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/2a\/4b\/b4\/81\/colee-hammock-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/2a\/4b\/b4\/80\/colee-hammock-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/2a\/4b\/b4\/7f\/colee-hammock-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/2a\/4b\/b4\/7e\/colee-hammock-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/2a\/4b\/b4\/7d\/colee-hammock-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Sep 2023 • Solo","UGS":"Fort Lauderdale_Colee Hammock Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.588719Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T20:01:48.753234Z","inner_id":1431,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3149,"annotations":[{"id":1437,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":110,"end":117,"text":"jogging","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"oehE3I5cYI","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-13T20:01:56.357383Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T20:01:56.357383Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.392,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"cacbf441-b2a0-4d31-882d-abfff24283a3","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3149,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"T0urist7","user_hometown":"Warsaw, Poland","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"relaxing","content":"Pretty nice, small and quiet Park.

I looked around, and everyone seemed to be decent (couples with little kids, older couples reading, teens just hanging out together & playing music).I didn't feel that anyone would steal my stuff, but since I had my passport, license, credit cards, and a hundred dollars in my bag, I asked an older woman to keep an eye on it. I placed it beside her chair. The sand was clean, the water was crystal clear and great temperature. I didn't get in the ocean, since I was alone, but was wishing I had brought my snorkel mask & someone along. I saw a couple of cruise ships on the horizon. There were fishing boats offshore, too.

There is an excellent film that should be viewed before the tour.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/0b\/4c\/ce\/historic-plaque.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/0b\/4c\/fd\/house-exterior.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/0b\/4d\/13\/broward-county-historic.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/0b\/4d\/24\/curci-family-photo.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/0b\/4d\/30\/mr-curci-s-violin.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/0b\/4d\/3c\/living-room-fireplace.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/12\/0b\/4d\/56\/dining-room.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Feb 2018 • Couples","UGS":"Hallandale Beach_Curci House-Historical Village"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.605957Z","updated_at":"2023-12-16T03:14:32.919322Z","inner_id":1603,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3321,"annotations":[{"id":1609,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":237,"end":310,"text":"Fitness\/Weight Room along with a host of other athletic fields and courts","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"GzMVesEYWB","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-14T02:20:47.952365Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T02:20:47.952365Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":33.216,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"82931ac2-1246-422d-9466-e66d54ae130d","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3321,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Scott K","user_hometown":"Davie, FL","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Classic Motorcycle Show","content":"Really cool little park that hosted this awesome event.

They lied. Instead, the Town Manager, Bud Bentley, personally rewrote the Tennis Court Rules for the specific purpose and with the specific intention of enabling that band of bullies to continue their bullying and bigoted behavior this year. The men still come to the courts before dawn to hold the courts and prevent tennis players who are not part of their group from accessing the courts.  Six times during our stay, I saw waiting players refused entry onto the courts by this group, even though they had monopolized the courts for hours. Instead of limiting court time when its busy, the town decided to let this group play for as long as they want and exclude the other 40 or so families who have rented a court key. On the plus side this year, Broward County Sheriff’s Deputies didn’t even visit once during the 11 times we played. There were no physical threats, although the machine-gun-wielding man from last year still plays here and is still a bully.  The woman who described my grandson in racist terms last still plays here, but managed to keep her mouth shut this year. Although we were on the receiving end of cursing, name-calling and offensive comments every day last year, there was none of that nastiness this year. Obviously, I and family had no difficulty accessing the courts during our two week stay. Although the new rules actually made it easier for us to play, they effectively enable the bully group to keep most other keyholders off the courts from 7a-11a, the prime playing time during the winter in South Florida. I hope that the Town Commissioners read this post, and require that the court rules be rewritten to promote equal access among all keyholders, not just this band of bullies.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Mar 2019 • Family","UGS":"Lauderdale by the Sea_Friedt Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.605957Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T02:42:37.283087Z","inner_id":1631,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3349,"annotations":[{"id":1637,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":4,"end":22,"text":"town tennis courts","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"x5ey3TCz3T","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":53,"end":63,"text":"pickleball","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"tEPe9Ezk0T","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":193,"end":203,"text":"Pickleball","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"lIcqfWfUoZ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":263,"end":276,"text":"tennis courts","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"BUnsxXU7MK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":284,"end":301,"text":"pickleball courts","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"YoHvGlADqk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-14T02:43:21.867031Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T02:43:21.867031Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-14T02:42:47.971369Z","lead_time":44.371,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"a693a851-d540-4222-8515-aeb84f25f4fc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3349,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"TrueBob","user_hometown":"Pennsylvania","rating":"1.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Pickleball Rules!","content":"The town tennis courts have never been busier...with pickleball now being the primary activity.

The entrance is gorgeous, the lake is beautiful and it’s one of the only parks around that has pavilions and a playground close by but it also has swings. I was sold on this park for my daughter’s first birthday. I ended up reserving pavilion #3 with a pretty unobstructed view of the lake. I planned for this birthday for 6 months. I spent way more money than I should have on a 1st birthday (things are expensive in South Florida and I have a BIG family) and my birthday party was pretty much a bust. The wind tunnel that is created in this pavilion, during a cold front, looked like a tornado. Even taping the table cloth down to the picnic tables would not keep them down (they would bubble with air), the beautiful balloon garland and cake backdrop I had planned for to be used with my elaborate cake\/dessert table was a bust and had to be taped down to the storage closet at the entrance of the pavilion using duct tape and it still blew off several times damaging the cake. None of the decorations I handmade for the party could be used. None of the decorative balloons could be used. My cousin bought stones at the dollar store just so we could put out the vases on the table but we couldn’t add the flowers because they would have blown over. I know you can’t control Mother Nature but WOW, I can’t be the only person this has happened to and based on a brief conversation I had with a park worker, Management at the park seems aware of this issue. The park needs to invest in wind blockers. Having known this issue in advance, I would have planned the party at this park differently. (for those that say I should have known, NO. All my parties are at parks and this is the first time I have this issue). Other things to consider, the line to get in is ridiculously long and the bathrooms were disgusting. My guests said they were absolutely nasty and overflowing. I'm sure this is due to the soccer tournament that was going on which also took all the parking spaces, even those blocked off for pavilion #3 (I was not made aware these were assigned to our pavilion until the party was over).","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Mar 2020","UGS":"Miramar_Miramar Regional Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.605957Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T02:51:48.431762Z","inner_id":1643,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3361,"annotations":[{"id":1650,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-14T02:52:01.811027Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T02:52:01.811027Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":13.177,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"17ce24ac-9cee-4a15-b7a8-9a5ae4522274","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3361,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Love-nature","user_hometown":"Pompano Beach, FL","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Pour une jolie promenade","content":"Une belle halte pour un pique-nique avec BBQ, pour une petite randonnée de vélo, parc de jeux pour enfants et d'entraînements.

Nice place to run or walk on a good day.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/82\/f8\/fd\/photo9jpg.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/82\/f8\/fa\/photo8jpg.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/82\/f8\/f8\/photo7jpg.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/82\/f8\/f4\/photo6jpg.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/82\/f8\/f3\/photo5jpg.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/82\/f8\/f2\/photo4jpg.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/82\/f8\/f1\/photo3jpg.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/82\/f8\/f0\/photo2jpg.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/82\/f8\/ee\/photo1jpg.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/1a\/82\/f8\/ed\/photo0jpg.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Jan 2020 • Friends","UGS":"Oakland Park_Jaco Pastorius Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.605957Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T02:52:39.230706Z","inner_id":1645,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3363,"annotations":[{"id":1652,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":17,"end":26,"text":"dog parks","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"z3FnzEa0nK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":63,"end":71,"text":"dog park","labels":["entertainment"]},"id":"eyrObwKIhk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-14T02:52:47.844143Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T02:52:47.844143Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":8.411,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"0102c697-9516-4332-9dfe-14156b956e3e","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3363,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"DiscountDuo","user_hometown":"88 contributions","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Excellent park","content":"One of the nicer dog parks we have visited.

They didn't allow a friend and myself on the course as a twosome because \"the course was too full,\" yet, when we got on the course there were a bunch of twosomes. We had no one behind us and caught up to a twosome in front of us, otherwise, very few people on the course (it was 5pm on a Tuesday). Seriously?

Located near I-75, Emerald Estates Park is located just outside the gates of the Emerald Estates community in Weston, a neighborhood made of 607 single family homes.Emerald Estates Park has many amenities including a shade covered playground, basketball courts, exercise path, outdoor fitness equipment, lighted tennis courts, picnic shelters and grill. There is even a bike Fixit Repair Station. Dogs are allowed as long as leashed.During my visit I saw a lot of people throughout the park exercising, playing tennis, and at the playground. I walked on the paved fitness trail and tried out the the outdoor exercise equipment. While I worked out I could see all of the birds attracted by the water in the park. At the back of the park is an island filled with wood storks, a large wading bird that is considered threatened in the United States. There were also a lot of cormorants too. Not only is this park a great place to play, exercise, and cook out but it is also a wildlife sanctuary and a fantastic place to bird watch.","img_urls":"https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/28\/d6\/80\/85\/emerald-estates-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/28\/d6\/80\/87\/emerald-estates-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/28\/d6\/80\/8b\/emerald-estates-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/28\/d6\/80\/84\/emerald-estates-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/28\/d6\/80\/86\/emerald-estates-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/28\/d6\/80\/88\/emerald-estates-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/28\/d6\/80\/89\/emerald-estates-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/28\/d6\/80\/8a\/emerald-estates-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/28\/d6\/80\/83\/emerald-estates-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1;https:\/\/dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-o\/28\/d6\/80\/82\/emerald-estates-park.jpg?w=200&h=-1&s=1;","tour_time":"Apr 2023 • Solo","UGS":"Weston_Emerald Estates Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.622496Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T03:22:40.925608Z","inner_id":1688,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3406,"annotations":[{"id":1695,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-14T03:22:52.590599Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T03:22:52.590599Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":11.465,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"bb2d0f4c-2b3f-411d-a9c0-d2124cf9ac9f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3406,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"134Laila","user_hometown":"Brasilia, DF","rating":"5.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Super fun!","content":"It was so cool going there with my kids.

The name of the park came from pioneer William Collier who planted an orange grove in the 1890's. The Seminoles liked his oranges and called him Colo which was a shortened form of Collier. The Seminole word for river was Hatchee so Colohatchee means Collier at the River.The last time I was here, the park was under renovation. It is so nice to see it open. There is a boardwalk from the parking lot that takes you through the mangroves, across the Middle River, and over to the dog park. You have to be registered to use the dog park. There are very few open dog parks any more but it is much safer to have everyone registered.I am so happy to see that Wilton Manors made it a priority to protect this patch of mangrove. The mangroves filter and clean the water, prevent erosion of the coastline, and provide a habitat and refuge to wildlife. The walk is short and it is nice that a boardwalk was put in here but the most important thing this park does is it improves the health of the Middle River.","img_urls":"","tour_time":"Mar 2021","UGS":"Wilton Manors_Colohatchee Park"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:56:12.622496Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T03:30:41.492390Z","inner_id":1703,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3421,"annotations":[{"id":1710,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":76,"end":92,"text":"tranquil respite","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"d_BZH7B9Im","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":155,"end":171,"text":"basketball court","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"IZJqmmDQSt","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":193,"end":213,"text":"walk toward the back","labels":["physical_use"]},"id":"WOpDc1fnV6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":223,"end":273,"text":"find the tributaries to the inter costal waterways","labels":["aesthetic"]},"id":"fmDyjE0hPJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-12-14T03:31:14.123905Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T03:31:14.123905Z","draft_created_at":"2023-12-14T03:30:59.834404Z","lead_time":32.414,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"dea8ae15-253c-4c29-a04f-a8fb5ff1f8a3","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3421,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90eab61c-random_label_tripadvisor_each20.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"user_id":"Adam","user_hometown":"Fort Lauderdale, FL","rating":"4.0 of 5 bubbles","title":"Relaxing Oasis","content":"The crowds on Wilton Drive can wear over time and Island City Park offers a tranquil respite.
